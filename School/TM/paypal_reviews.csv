Paypal sucks. When you lock your card you still get your money stolen and when you dispute it or try to get your money back for something you didn't even have. They pretty much tell you to screw off because they don't want to refund the money stole by them.

Honestly, I had to double-check that I didn’t accidentally open a bargain-basement shopping app by mistake. PayPal…seriously, what’s happening over there? Is this an app or a junk mail subscription?

Paypal needs to get their Pay in 4 feature under control. Customer service claims they have no access to fix system errors or why things decline. Right now I just paid off all my pay in 4 loans with no delinquency and the system is denying me new loans due to too many open loans. How? Beyond frustrating. They need to do a system like Afterpay. You get a $ credit limit and as you pay more loans off it increases with guaranteed approval up to that dollar amount listed. Pay in 4 is unpredictable.,1,2024-11-02 18:13:23,95

Use caution when you switch banks if you have automatic payments set up for the credit line.

"Been with Paypal for over a decade. Their business practices are generally ok but when they review your account (which they'll do OFTEN), they will prevent you from making money processing credit card transactions. I'm in the middle of seeking an alternative (maybe Square) but I wanted to stop and let others know ton avoid dealing with Paypal for business purposes. They'll block access to your account where you cannot make or move your own money!!",2,2024-10-21 03:24:02,76

Security nightmare. When attempting to delete an account the default option will NOT delete any of the data related to that account.

Do not use this service. Massive class action lawsuits against them. Their platform is riffe with scammers that they allow to immediately transfer funds so the innocent consumers has zero recourse to cancel the funds.

Terrible service enslaved by arbitrary decision making and deceitful practices. On October 11 2024 PayPal silently updated their Terms of Service to allow them to arbitrarily ban anyone associated with an account found in violation of prior ToS iterations regardless of whether the associated account(s) had committed any violation themselves. The wave of bans from the 12th to 15th were all actuated RETROACTIVELY for ANY interaction with an account that had violated the former ToS.,1,2024-10-16 19:25:33,75
"Do not like how they manage your account. There were charges on my account which I disputed because they weren't mine. Paypal didn't care based on their attitudes that I was charged over $200 on my account on companies I never bought from, and we're fraudulent companies. They never investigated properly on the displayed charges and told me I had to pay it when I never bought anything. I was not satisfied at all with what they did to investigate these fraudulent scammers.",2,2024-10-16 15:21:55,83

"They absolutely suck when it comes to being scammed. They don't tell you important information until a month or so later so then YOU have to do the work for their mistake.

"Do not even bother. My account got restricted the FIRST TIME I tried to use it to receive some birthday money from overseas, due to ""suspicious activity"" . This app is completely unhelpful regarding customer support, and leads you in circles when trying to resolve it. I had to issue a refund, which takes about 5 days, or seven days, the app was vague about that too. Probably never see that money again.

Terrible recent experience! Whatever they did to their app with this new guise of security is nothing but annoyance. I have been jumping through hoops and being given the runaround via useless articles for over a month and I still can't access my funds.

But I won't be using them if there's any other choice.,1,2024-10-12 09:40:36,79

The app require you to enter the account password to login in order to pay for the paypal master credit card. Do you actually want people to pay the credit card bill or not? Why so discouraging to people who needs to pay for the bill of your company's card? 2. Checking the paypal master credit card total spending requires password too. Why???,1,2024-09-25 14:48:46,86

Great for ease of service but if you're international (I'm Canadian) it's a total rip off on exchange rates. I've even gone as far as opening a US funds account but PayPal refuses to clear my funds in USD or take payments in USD.

Paypal is the worst pile of garbage I can remember dealing with in a very long time. Customer service line goes to busy signal and breaks. Couldn't add my card to my new account because it was supposedly connected to my old account I had deleted. They give out a debit card pretending to be like a normal way to pay for things but then my father sends me $200 to buy a new phone as a gift and it's put on hold for 3 weeks???

Sold items as described then PayPal let buyer put claim after claim in until they got their money back. Never informed me that this was happening so I could provide proof of everything.

It is SUPER ANNOYING to have to find my 2FA code every time i open the app in my phone. 2FA should be needed for logging in - not for opening the app in my own device every time. We have biometrics protection for that. Even other banking apps don't ask for 2FA to open their app every time in users own/known device,2,2024-07-15 01:22:56,63
Horrible app. Just horrible. Can't add my card because it says it's linked to another account. But guess what my secondary account is also not having the card.

"Besides the fact that the app is destroyed by the competition, the fees are too damn big, it makes me not want to take out the money this way, other apps have way smaller fee, also conversion fees are bad, transaction fees are high, the only way to use paypal is to pay with it online and take money straight from the card, but why do this if i can just use my debit card, literally there is no more reason to use this money grab",1,2024-07-14 20:55:51,86

Are you leaving a review for PayPal in the USA? Fraudsters are now stalking your social media. Paypal calls you a seller even if you aren't and it doesn't indicate if payments to your account are friend related or based on some goods/services whether or not you are selling anything. I have lost funds through PP before. The fees they charge add up big time. They allow bogus disputes to mess with citizens. They require endless sign ins and security pictures to manage your account.

"Keep trying to transfer money. It's only good for holding your money in the app and card. They don't want you to transfer it out. Anything deposited will not be transferred to outside accounts, including and especially European accounts. They only want to keep your money. Every time I put in a valid IBAN it is denied, even though I've gone through all their ""anti-hacker"" and ""anti-fraud"" hoops. It's just a lie to keep your money and stay in business. If they traded more it wouldn't be dying",1,2024-07-08 06:55:47,88
Currently there is a bug that prevents the use of the app when you have 2 factor authentication enabled. This is known to PayPal.l per customer service.

I would give NO stars if I could. The PayPal debit card is a NetSpend card with PayPal stamped on it the fees are absolutely ridiculous. I had a check for $8 dollars and some change that I received in the mail and I tried to cash it on PayPal and they wanted $5 just to cash the check or I could wait 10 days for free which is absolutely criminal.

This will stay a 1 (it would be zero if I could) until it is fixed. BOOOO! I've already.reported the issue multiple ways and have gotten No Assistance!",1,2024-06-22 12:37:24,87

If I could I'd give NO stars for this app. I installed it on 6/20/24 for the first time. I was trying to send money to my friend but found out later that her Facebook/Messenger account had been hacked. I tried to get my money back and PayPal said based on my history that it was a legitimate transaction and my money will not be refunded. How can I have a history installing an app for the first time?!? It is uninstalled and I'll never use it again!,1,2024-06-22 04:55:03,88
Stop using paypal guys. I recently transacted with someone who received the products he bought from me but still filed a case. I provided more evidence that it was delivered in good faith but they still refunded the money in the buyer's favor. Very disappointing,1,2024-06-22 02:33:29,45
"Their maltreatment for customers is too much. I only asked for a change of my first name (Moses to Adeoye). They maltreated me and terminated my account and withheld fund for 180days of no access. The two names in question are part of my full name and I have ID card to back it up. In Nigeria, Voter's ID, NIM slip ID are the most recognisable Government ID to verify/certify someone's personality in which I submitted to them. Is it a crime to ask for a change of name.

So disappointed with your app. I've been working at the same job for 6 months getting the same paychecks and using your mobile deposit app. Each time it's taking longer and longer to use. It prompted me to sign my check take the proper photos and said that they would begin a review 10 minutes later I was still waiting I finally gave up. No notice no message as to why it didn't go through. Please fix for better rating,2,2024-06-21 12:42:58,80

How the hell is it a security issue every time I try to add money to my PayPal account? Have to call service and they override it and the next time it does it again. Not withdrawing but adding money from the account is a security issue? This is why I rarely use PayPal and not dare put a larger sum of money in. If adding money to PayPal sets off a security issue how am I to know if I'm paying for dinner it's not going to do the same thing leaving me no access to my money? Can't trust you.,1,2024-06-21 02:14:23,102

Even though credit cards expire and keeping an old one makes no sense. They want me to contact the bank and ask for old documents and they don't accept my national ID for proving I am me.

"This is more of a review of the master card available than anything. Absolutely awful. They kept freezing my account and putting my payments to them on hold because I payed more than one payment a month which is ""unusal behavior"". It's only unusual because they want you to keep that credit card debt. They just want you in perpetual debt tip you die. They did this all without contacting me. I had to call and speak to a very rude customer service employee. The rest of the other features are fine",1,2024-06-14 07:08:29,92
I hope you can add the features as advertised to all countries you allow paypal in. Because I'm not able to do much in terms of as description and upon contacting support they said those features are not available in my country. It's really frustrating when I'm doing international transactions and can't transfer funds from bank to paypal and vice versa. The finance option is just not avaliable. I can do only the bare minimum.,2,2024-06-14 05:49:35,75

"The unnecessary inconvenience for the sake of security makes everything take much longer. Do you believe redirecting people to read articles for help, just to accomplish basic tasks, is a viable option? They seem very proud of the system, but it feels like a void without proper guidance.

My friend sent me money so I can purchase our tickets for a vacation we were planning but PayPal broke her total in two and withdrew it from two of her accounts and because she didn't know, and assumed it was suspicious activity, she called her bank and put a stop/ hold on the transaction.

I made a claim on the 29th of April for a refund because my order that was placed on 19th of March never arrived. Shortly after I made the complaint the seller decided to send me a different parcel this time from a different country even though I've specifically requested the refund as the products were not needed anymore.

You won't allow purchases of bitcoin or add money to paypal account from my Mastercard and bank Mastercard which I used to use often. I've tried calling three times and got no help.

In settings you can set 2FA but it requires third party app like microsoft authenticator. Also password can have only up to 20 characters.

Won't be using this app anymore. If you get a payment and someone selects good and Services by accident or on purpose they hold the money for 21 days and they won't release it until then even if you have a service that doesnt ship or provide a product. Would give 0 stars do not use also don't use Venmo Try Cashapp or a normal bank.,1,2024-05-14 02:56:43,66

They're customer service barely speaks English, and they charge more than any other mobile banking app. And I tried to dispute a clearly fraudulent purchase for a period tracker and I'm a guy and they wouldnt refund me about 2 hours after I got the charge.

PayPal is a scam and an effin joke. They will place a limitation on your account and hold your money. Use other apps like cash app or even Venmo. I will not be using PayPal for my business or personal use any longer. They won't even release my own money that I sent to myself to test the business invoice process. Garbage Use policy and excuses to hold onto your money to tie it up. Probably so they can make money off of it and not pay you interest.,1,2024-05-03 06:55:24,89

"Horrible and dishonest! They took my payment away from bank account (not a check) but did not credit back to my credit card, until I caught them! The customer service person on the phone saying they have rights to do that! Other bank don't steal money from their customer, you are paid once you submit the payment, if the money is not enough it is our own responsibility, but PayPal act like hold the payment is doing the customer's favor! Lol what a theif. Highly recommend to stay away from them!!",1,2024-04-13 13:16:38,91
"Attempted since the beginning of last year to get a refund for a charge I didn't approve in that amount, over $80! I immediately let them know that this was fraud. But I kept getting the runaround. Requested proof of the charge n items for which I never received a confirmation email. I also never received anything from the scammer. How could I proof something I never received any info about nor items I'd return? That was it for me! Very bad higher ups customer service 👎. Never again!",1,2024-04-13 09:52:55,89
"Limited functionality if you live overseas. This does not allow you to add temporary foreign addresses. There's no drop down menu for ""country"". The app assumes that you want to add a US only address. You might have to close your US paypal and open a new one in the country you live in. Choose someother payment method that has more flexibility for delivery addresses.",1,2024-04-13 09:52:38,65
I have not been able to log in to the app so I uninstalled it. I keep getting the stupid 'No internet connection' message' even though every other app is fine. Fix this! I will not reinstall until it works! I have reinstalled more than once. The app works for awhile then the stupid message comes back. Clearing the cache doesn't help.

The app is not as good as Venmo. There is no authorizing and verifying with phone number or email. It is very easy to mistakenly send money to someone with the same name as the person you are trying to send it to.,1,2024-04-12 21:31:20,43

I am having trouble logging into the app. It won't accept my fingerprint. I do the images and it won't log me in. I put my email and password in and it won't take that either. It keeps saying no Internet connection when I have full 5G bars and then when I am connected to a full bar Internet connection it still says no Internet connection. I have never had this issue before I am extremely upset by this. I have even uninstalled and reinstalled then cleared the cache. Nothing is working.,1,2024-04-12 20:06:06,92
Registration _ try to Register on a different phone. PayPal have changed the way DoB is entered. Instead of just selecting date from days months and years - 6 clicks - one now has to click on that calendar umpteen times. Eg I was born in 1954. That is 70 years ago. This means I have to press that back arrow button 70×12=840 times to get to the year of birth. Seriously??? Well done Paypal IT department. 👏,1,2024-04-12 19:01:43,78
"Cash app is so much better than PayPal, I've had to call over a dozen times because my transfers wouldn't go through to my bank account, all because I had to answer questions about fraud, even though I use the phone that's connected to the account, they weren't even large amounts and I had to wait 24 hrs for their review.PayPal sucks",1,2024-04-12 18:25:48,62
"Random person sent me money twice, requested refund, then filed case against me. Had no clue what was going on so I left it alone.

I've been suspended for over 6months now. Not to mention the fact that I get logged out CONSTANTLY and have to verify.",1,2024-04-12 16:29:17,94

"It's easier to get into Fort Knox than log into this app. How many cars, motorcycles, and busses do you need me to select?!

"Terrible UI, impossible to switch between personal and business accounts, or add other managers to business accounts.

I will never do business with this company ever again. Their customer service representatives are oblivious to direct instructions and they also do not help at all. They fail on any promises of sending any kind of email and they also failed on returning money to customers way after 5 business days. Wait after 7 business days. It's not the car issue or the bank that is holding any kind of return it's lost in PayPal system and they refuse to honor it and fix their mistakes I do not trust this app,1,2024-04-12 01:03:03,93
"Crashes the second I login.

The absolutely worst app to use to manage your money. Super broken system.

"Worst user interface, worst customer support, worst chat assistant, and even worse customer support executives. Even if it's an international enterprise, forget services in English language on call, especially if you are living in a European country, like Germany in my case. They will ask you to ""learn German to get desired support"", or we will mock you or humiliate you. This is the behavior after paying an overhead fee of 30€ to get a hard earned payment released. This is classic harassment!",1,2024-04-06 05:00:22,83
"I am writing to express my disappointment with the level of client care I’ve experienced. As a customer, I expect a certain standard of service and responsibility, which I feel has not been met. Issues have arisen that were not addressed with the urgency and attention I anticipated. It is crucial for a financial service provider to maintain trust and reliability. Unfortunately, my recent experiences have led me to question this. I hope that PayPal will take this feedback seriously....",1,2024-04-06 02:23:58,80

Good day sir / madam Trust you are doing well & safe ? PayPal is registered under Singapore and Singapore regulations apply & not the interest of a greedy American company PayPal This email will go viral within 48 hours should all PayPal clients request be met money on hold for what valid reason There is no such thing as 180 days hold on an account & all accounts on hold within the 180 days should be paid to PayPal holders with interest & compounding interest is this not how business,1,2024-04-05 23:14:27,91

"This is the worst most frustrating finance app I've ever had. The user experience is maddening, nothing is clear how it works, the top up process is absurd (works with local websites geared towards different local payment methods and the websites looks extremely shady that at a certain moment I thought I landed on a phishing website), when trying to add new payment methods it gives an error but no explanation as to what is wrong. Extremely dissapointed with this app!!",1,2024-04-05 18:32:33,81

"PayPal is undoubtedly the worst financial service I have ever used. It puzzles me how so many people continue to use it. Ignoring the fact that the app has piss-poor functionality at best, the customer service is just as useless. Nothing works as intended, and if your account is ever permanently limited, you can no longer use the service. If you have bank accounts and cards attached to your account, they will be stuck there forever. I've contacted them numerous times, and they can't do a thing.",1,2024-04-05 02:24:55,87

Then when you request a refund, PP says it was unauthorized and so it isn't covered. WHAT?!? Yes, of course, it was unauthorized! That's what I'm requesting a refund.

There are better apps to send to friends and better apps to send to friends internationally. People are more likely to try scam you on PayPal and PayPal will do nothing to help you at all they will only send debt collectors after you when you were the one who was scammed Even if you have told them and provided evidence while the investigation on their side is still open they will send those debt collectors.

And just because my balance went up to $90, it resulted in a 39 point drop on my credit score.",2,2024-03-11 02:00:13,77
0 star. The absolute worst App for people living in Africa. My account was banned just minutes after verification. Apparently this is common PayPal behaviour with African accounts. An absolute nightmare for freelancers here since you wait until we are sent a substantial amount then ban the account. You would have had it all PayPal but your culture of discrimination won't allow you there. To anyone in Africa just use Grey. It's better than this nonsense.,1,2024-03-10 21:25:54,76

The app will automatically freeze your funds in the middle of transactions for reasons that no one can seem to articulate or do anything about when contacted. It is impossible to know when or why a transaction will be frozen. This occurs wether the transaction is routine or unique. If you're doing any sort of transaction that requires timely payment you should look elsewhere. If time is not a factor then this is a good app for you.,2,2024-03-09 14:50:39,78

Somehow PayPal was able to get access to a debit card that I had used on Google Play and charged my brother's account for $20 when I called customer service they continue to tell me that I had set the card up on PayPal even though they could not find the record to where I set it up then then for me that I had to get ahold of the company to get my refund because there was nothing they could do about it.,1,2024-03-09 01:26:56,84

Horrible experience with cashing a check option on here as it forces you to void out your check once it's submitted only to not be able to reupload your voided check because it keeps glitching out and telling me the app has stoppd working. No help whatsoever on customer service side and now my check is ruined because it has void all over it. Its going to take me weeks to get a new check reissued now. What an unbelievable nightmare. I'll never use the cash a check option ever again.,1,2024-03-08 14:39:31,91

A friend has just paid me £1,133 by mistake, instead of £11.33. Luckily were in a position to fix the issue without consequence, but it needs to be fixed.",2,2024-03-08 05:39:36,89

PayPal is literally the worst. I did nothing and got banned i literally put in my details the needed and then waited and they permanently banned me. It's not worth your time and now just really really looks like a huge scam. Then also show 0 other way to contact them other then calling them. Which I don't want to do cause I have issues with calling. So unless this can get solved I'm saying dont buy it acts like a scam,1,2024-03-02 01:17:28,82

"While general payments and banking transactions are fine, I'm extremely disappointed with how expensive the crypto transactions are. PayPal charges and egregious cost to purchase/ on board/ cryptocurrencies. Not only are there fees for the purchase but the exchange rates are horrible. For instance, if Bitcoin is trading at 60,000 on coinbase or around the world anywhere, you are paying 61,000 ish with PayPal. It's just too expensive to on board and I'm very disappointed.",1,2024-02-29 21:13:25,75

Very disappointed on how they handle multiple unauthorized transactions on my account. I had more than enough proof that the transaction were not made by me. I've been a loyal customer for 20+ years and they seem to have fallen short on customer resolutions and now side with larger companies who are ripping people off.

I will never use PayPal for anything ever again. Chime and cash app are much better services.,1,2024-02-21 15:35:44,80
I will never be using this app again a customer filed a charge back but he said it was an accident even in the dispute conversation he said it was an accident but my account was still locked and i had to verify multiple transactions which I did and they still took my money even though MULTIPLE representatives could see where he said it was a mistake NO ONE could explain why i was still found at fault lies and obfuscation is all i have received BEWARE!!!,1,2024-02-21 12:35:39,87
"Completely saturated with the typical BS one may expect from PayPal. Expect to get rekt, robbed, and refusals for you to use YOUR money! The rep i spoke with saw the denial of my rent payment on their end, and acknowledged it.

Cash me out schmucks!",1,2024-02-21 05:04:29,75
"PayPal is horrible. I haven't used my account and went to finish setting it up only to find out my account had been hacked. Rather than work with me to restore my account they banned me for ""violating their standards"". How can I violate something when I did nothing wrong? Horrible company. Even worse customer service if you can call it that. I can't even close the account and they have all of my information.",1,2024-02-21 01:33:05,75

Why did you allow PayPal in Nigeria if you people don't allow us here in Nigeria to send money to each other. What is that need of the PayPal account. I really don't know why other countries can send money to each other but in Nigeria nobody is allowed to send us money. You guys should better remove the application from Nigeria so we know that PayPal doesn't exist.,1,2024-02-20 09:04:57,69
"The app is basically worthless. Using PayPal through the web is more detailed and easier to navigate. Getting money someone sent to you shouldn't be so difficult. Not only was i charged ridiculous fee's, i still haven't received all of it yet. Partial payment is on hold. PayPal separated amount in 2 and charged a fee on both. Crooks!!

"I feel robbed by the exchange rates every time I do an international transaction.

Honestly I will rate this app a 0 star. I won't recommend anyone to ever make use of this PayPal app or site. How is it possible that you guys logged me out of my account and won't let me login back. It keeps telling me incorrect info whereas I'm certain of my information. I have even requested for a recheck password and gotten a newer password and yet still the same outcome.

I loved paypal until I paid for someone else's Netflix for 14 months. Yes I was partly to blame for not paying closer attention but I also have Netflix and didnt catch there were 2 separate charges. PayPal argued with me when I finally did catch it and told them it wasnt me and couldn't tell them the email that was associated with that charge. I received 1 month refund. It's a easy app to use just be careful because they are NOT watching your charges like your bank does.,1,2024-02-18 08:46:28,90

There was a fraudulent transaction on my account that was linked to my bank. My bank said to take it up with PayPal.

Unfortunately this happens intermittently and I'll have forgotten th password so have to go through their security checks to confirm it's me.

So I could find a phone and easily gain access to th phone owners PayPal - if today's experience is normal.,2,2024-02-13 23:06:52,90

Very insecure service. Anyone can send you money as a business transaction without your knowledge or consent. Then PayPal will allow them to charge it all back without consulting you or confirming anything. And they'll overdraw your account for thousands of dollars you never had. Then try to send you to collections who'll try to intimidate you into paying it when they don't report to the credit bureaus anyway. Lesson learned. PayPal sucks and doesn't care about fraud against their users.,1,2024-02-02 21:41:10,81

How PATHETIC is this security? A few months ago I changed all passwords and contacts because someone hacked my account and turned off all security settings. This included 2FA which was never actually activated so is really a zero factor authentication. Today it happened again and I can get no support from PayPal.

This is the absolute worst app you can choose to be paid through if you are a seller. Until you get established and make a certain amount of sales they think it's okay to just hold your money for up to 21. There's a message that says you will get paid one day after your item is delivered and that is a complete lie. My item was delivered a week ago and it still says funds are on hold. Although Ive had it for a while because I don't use it often it's the same as being a new user. Ridiculous!,1,2024-01-21 05:48:03,101

Please to all my Africans working with PayPal in Africa let's unitedly uninstalled it if we can't enjoy all like those in Europe and America",1,2024-01-05 13:05:13,90
"I wouldn't recommend anymore. Having to many issues into regards to PayPal wallet and paying for things online using four ways payment. Keep saying the funds are not paid, when they are and then saying I'm two payments behind in the pay four agreement when I'm one only. Try and call to organise what's going on and they blame the bank. Before when I would send money over or make payments it would be done within minutes now PayPal takes a week to add funds to payments or wallet. Not happy!",1,2024-01-05 05:29:32,91
As others have suggested this app is now completely useless as it constantly crashes - you don't even need to do anything it's just going around in circles of logging in and shutting down. I too have uninstalled and reinstalled and cleared cache but nothing works. Please resolve ASAP PayPal- it's very disappointing.,1,2024-01-05 03:49:46,53
Continues to crash when trying to end an automatic payment. I signed up for a subscription that I no longer use and I used PayPal as my payment method. I'll never do that again and I don't recommend you do it either because this app will crash when you try to cancel your automatic payment.,1,2024-01-04 23:27:23,55
"Die haben mich -ohne mich zu fragen- bei einer Antivirus-Software angemeldet, sodass der Abo automatisch lief. In der App stand aber keine Hinweise darüber. Später wurde ich für 3 € an einer Inkassobüro gemeldet und musste 50 € zahlen 😡 Nie wieder 👎👎👎",1,2024-01-04 20:17:18,43
"I have made account after account, because you keep telling wrong log in info. then when I finally get one to work, you send not 1 but 2 different cards to the wrong address.

Horrendous and then abusive and rude to me after mishandling lost or not delivery of purchases. First huge amount transactions overcharged and frozen for 3 weeks during the holidays and my birthday after my mom died first holidays alone Constantly hindered and blocked from my account log in for a year and they didn't even have the audacity to blame me for any of it just playing God and satin most definitely more tribe of natases' I detest the app and it's customer service exchange 💯💩💩💩💩💩,1,2024-01-04 16:23:14,86

I cannot access my savings in the PayPal app. I had to delete it off my phone to be able to get access to it. Because if I go to the website to try it pulls me back to the app anytime I want to use my savings. This is a unacceptable bug. Uninstalling and reinstalling and clearing the cash doesn't work.,1,2024-01-04 04:35:20,62
I would not recommend ever getting this app they falsely limited my account and gave me no info on how to resolve the issue I've been dealing with this problem since October of 2023 and I have received no useful help they will leave your account limited without you able to delete it or fix the problem it's just a problematic company with no real people to help you with your problems I do not recommend using PayPal so zero stars from me,1,2024-01-04 01:26:45,83
I'm no longer getting alerts and I forget to make my payment on time if at all for the month due to a busy life like most people. When I go in to make sure my alerts are set up properly it says that currently unavailable for mobile.

I have downloaded this app twice already and I still can't sign up because it says I can't be sent a code I need to try again later. Honestly my high hopes for the app were shattered to think I was recommending it to my friends and family.,1,2024-01-03 14:52:39,48
I can't believe i can't see my virtual card information It put me thru hell I put the money on there easily I should be able to pull it out easily Some phones aren't compatible Some phones can't tap to pay Change my options Why bother having a wallet if money can't be easily transferred,1,2024-01-03 11:13:12,55
Horrible. Tried to add funds to my PayPal account with my debit card. But the transaction refused to go through. I have more than enough money in my bank account but the app refused to let me add $25. I would close my PayPal account but it has 1 penny left in it. So I just deleted the app. Screw this.,1,2024-01-03 10:58:08,61
App works ok but I have stopped using as there is no longer any payment protection as offered. My experience is any disputed transaction goes through what seems to be an automated process that eventually always sides with the other party. This makes bussiness sense as if PayPal process a refund they miss out on their cut. I have found a seperate visa debit with only a few dollars in it much more reliable and cuts out this middle man.,2,2024-01-03 09:27:35,80
EDIT: DO NOT USE PAYPAL SERVICES. THEY LOCKED ME OUT OF MY ACCOUNT AND LOCKED MY CARD WITHOUT MY CONSENT. AM SEEKING A LAWYER AS WE SPEAK. Money goes missing out of your account without warning or consent. Told me it was a internal security breach that doesn't even have a phone number and which is also automated. I closed my account and switched to Cash app bc they have no fees or bullshirt,1,2024-01-03 08:40:39,74
"Used to be a great app. For the past month and a half I've been dealing with account limitations, denied payments and have gotten nowhere. I've had to change my password so many times!!!

En teoría era la mejor opción y más rápida para mi pero me equivoqué es un asco.",1,2024-01-03 04:12:31,65
Horrible app experience first I shipped a item I sold. The app would not let me put in tracking number then said I had to wait get my money. I waited 2 weeks no money called in then was told it was never released due to no tracking number. Take I mind app would freeze up when I tried to add tracking. 3rd after my money was cleared did a transfer to my bank account guess what another waiting time oh wait now there is another waiting time. Use something different or wait a month to get paid.,1,2024-01-03 02:05:04,98
"Update: they amended the $2500 fine for 'misinformation' but say they can still FINE you $2500 for violating their acceptable use policy (Nov 2022).

Please read review in its entirety maybe this will help you make a decision on not to use pay pal. Tried using pay pal friends and family to pay a family friend for something very important the funds were sent via (ECheck) and I was told they should be received within 3-7 business days well now we are on business day 8 (only counting mon-fri) and day # 10 in total and the funds still say pending. Don't bother contacting customer support because they are no help. I will be contacting legal help,1,2024-01-02 20:40:53,93
Isn't working right has account limitations and doesn't process payments of any kind or anything I try to attempt to pay for via Google play or the app itself or online wifi....I can't get a data plan working however so it's probably just my bad I need a data service plan with a phone number,1,2024-01-02 16:37:08,55

You can set up an account and can't immediately access your funds you gotta do a bunch of B's there an easier way and you don't have to argue with their representatives that are very predgidice.. and they parley and gossip and have little party's while theu pretend to work for us the people...

"Hi, I have been using this PayPal in Australia as an app on my phone and as a website. Whenever I try to log in, they are asking me to add a phone number so that they can send me text messages.

No? Thanks anyway. Deposit it. No reason to chat about it. Constantly tries to stop you from getting your own money with security tricks. Now its face scan. Thieves!!,1,2024-01-02 07:21:02,67

Worst customer service EVER.!!!!!! Yeah they initially seemed like they were going to work it out and unrestrict it with the first person I talked to and then a week later I called again and they said no they were not going to change and that they didn't have to give me the reason why. For my account limitation!!! Also I was refunded the 49.76 because that was a fraudulent unrecognized charge that was refunded after a phone call with y'all. And I had made a phone about my account limitation.,1,2024-01-01 23:23:00,91

PayPal. They have control over your money not you. And when they finally allow you access to your own funds they just put a hold until you identify yourself for the 10th time in 2 months. All for your security of course. Pretty sure that money of ours they constantly dont allow access to is drawing them interest during the 3 weeks or so it takes them to verify and release funds. They are a bunch of crooks,1,2024-01-01 07:08:45,78
