In United States Government-sponsored phase 3 efficacy trials of COVID-19 vaccines, nAbs are measured by two different validated pseudovirus-based SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays, with each trial using one of the two assays. Here we describe and compare the nAb titers obtained in the two assays. We observe that one assay consistently yielded higher nAb titers than the other when both assays were performed on the World Health Organizationâ€™s anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin International Standard, COVID-19 convalescent sera, and mRNA-1273 vaccinee sera. To overcome the challenge this difference in readout poses in comparing/combining data from the two assays, we evaluate three calibration approaches and show that readouts from the two assays can be calibrated to a common scale. These results may aid decision-making based on data from these assays for the evaluation and licensure of new or adapted COVID-19 vaccines.</AbstractText></Abstract>",0,2021-09-26 00:00:00

                <AbstractText>The novelty of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is that it is occurring in a globalized society enhanced by digital capabilities. Our aim was to analyze the psychological and emotional states of participants in different pandemic-related contexts, with a focus on their digital and physical distancing behaviors. The online survey was applied during the ascending phase of the pandemic in March 2020 in two neighboring EU countries: Italy and Croatia. The study subjects involved four groups, two directly affected by epidemiological measures and two serving as controls-(1) participants from Italy who were in lockdown (Italy group), (2) participants from Croatia who were not in lockdown but who were in direct contact with an infected person and underwent epidemiological measures (CRO-contact group), (3) participants from Croatia who were in an analogous situation but not near the same infected person (CRO-no contact group), and (4) participants from Croatia who were not aware of any infected person (CRO-unrelated group). The survey consisted of validated scales of psychological and emotional states, and custom-made questionnaires on the digital (online) and physical (off-line) behavior of the participants. The Italy group in lockdown had higher self-perceived scores for depression, stress, post-traumatic intrusion, and avoidance, as well as the highest digital activity and physical distancing than the not-in-lockdown Croatian groups. The insight into the extent of online activities and off-line isolation allowed for the introduction of Digital Activity and Physical Distancing Scores. Self-perceived post-traumatic avoidance was higher in both the Italy and CRO-contact groups than the control CRO-no contact and CRO-unrelated groups, and higher avoidance correlated with higher Digital Activity and Physical Distancing Scores. Being in direct contact with the infected person, the CRO-contact group had no other alterations than unexpectedly lower post-traumatic hyperarousal when compared with the Italy group. The Italy group in lockdown demonstrated higher self-perceived psychological toll together with higher digital activity and physical distancing than Croatian groups not in lockdown, even when compared with the affected CRO-contact group. The study outcomes suggest that the general emergency measures influenced citizens in lockdown more than exposure to the virus through direct contact with an infected person.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Post-COVID-19 patients, particularly those who needed high care, are expected to have high needs for physical, psychological and cognitive rehabilitation. Yet, the resources needed to provide rehabilitation treatment are expected to be inadequate because healthcare systems faced a shortage of high-quality treatment of these symptoms already before the COVID-19 crisis emerged in patients with comparable needs. In this viewpoint, we discuss the potential of Virtual Reality (VR) administering fast, tailor-made rehabilitation at a distance, and offering a solution for the impending surge of demand for rehabilitation after COVID-19. VR consists of a head-mounted display (HMD) that can bring the user by computer-generated visuals into an immersive, realistic multi-sensory environment. Several studies on VR show its potential for rehabilitation and suggest VR to be beneficial in post-COVID-19. The immersion of VR may increase therapy adherence and may distract the patient from experienced fatigue and anxiety. Barriers still have to be overcome to easily implement VR in healthcare. We argue that embedding VR in virtual care platforms would assist in overcoming these barriers and would stimulate the spread of VR therapy, both for post-COVID-19 patients in the present and possibly for other patients with similar rehabilitation needs in the future.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>In Serbia less than 13% of collected municipal wastewaters is being treated before their release in the environment. This includes all municipal wastewater discharges from Belgrade (capital city of Serbia; population 1,700,000). Previous research has identified the impacts of raw wastewater discharges from Belgrade on the Danube River, and this study investigated if such discharges also provided a pathway for SARS-CoV-2 RNA material. Samples were collected during the most critical circumstances that occurred so far within the COVID-19 pandemics in Serbia. Grab and composite samples were collected in December 2020, during the peak of the third wave (in terms of reported cases) at the site which receives the wastewater loads in Belgrade. Grab samples collected upstream and downstream of Belgrade were also analyzed. RNA was quantified using RT-qPCR with primer sets targeting nucleocapsid (N1 and N2) and envelope (E) protein genes. SARS-CoV-2 RNA (5.97 × 10<sup>3</sup> to 1.32 × 10<sup>4</sup> copies/L) was detected only in samples collected at the site strongly impacted by the wastewaters where all three applied primer sets gave positive signals. Determined concentrations correspond to those reported in wastewater influents sampled at treatment plants in other countries indicating an epidemiological indicator function of used approach for rivers with high pollution loads in countries with poor wastewater treatment.</AbstractText>

While several studies suggest that immune dysregulation plays a central role, the key mediators of this process are yet to be defined. Here, we demonstrate that plasma from a high proportion (93%) of critically ill COVID-19 patients, but not healthy controls, contains broadly auto-reactive immunoglobulin M (IgM) and less frequently auto-reactive IgG or IgA. Importantly, these auto-IgMs preferentially recognize primary human lung cells <i>in vitro</i>, including pulmonary endothelial and epithelial cells. By using a combination of flow cytometry, analytical proteome microarray technology, and lactose dehydrogenase (LDH)-release cytotoxicity assays, we identify high-affinity, complement-fixing, auto-reactive IgM directed against 260 candidate autoantigens, including numerous molecules preferentially expressed on the cellular membranes of pulmonary, vascular, gastrointestinal, and renal tissues. These findings suggest that broad IgM-mediated autoimmune reactivity may be involved in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19, thereby identifying a potential target for therapeutic interventions.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>© 2021 The Author(s).</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>",0,2021-06-17 00:00:00

                <AbstractText>Understanding when SARS-CoV-2 emerged is critical to evaluating our current approach to monitoring novel zoonotic pathogens and understanding the failure of early containment and mitigation efforts for COVID-19. We employed a coalescent framework to combine retrospective molecular clock inference with forward epidemiological simulations to determine how long SARS-CoV-2 could have circulated prior to the time of the most recent common ancestor. Our results define the period between mid-October and mid-November 2019 as the plausible interval when the first case of SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Hubei province. By characterizing the likely dynamics of the virus before it was discovered, we show that over two-thirds of SARS-CoV-2-like zoonotic events would be self-limited, dying out without igniting a pandemic. Our findings highlight the shortcomings of zoonosis surveillance approaches for detecting highly contagious pathogens with moderate mortality rates.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>We have worked to develop a Clinical Information Network (CIN) in Kenya as an early form of learning health systems (LHS) focused on paediatric and neonatal care that now spans 22 hospitals. CIN's aim was to examine important outcomes of hospitalisation at scale, identify and ultimately solve practical problems of service delivery, drive improvements in quality and test interventions. By including multiple routine settings in research, we aimed to promote generalisability of findings and demonstrate potential efficiencies derived from LHS. We illustrate the nature and range of research CIN has supported over the past 7 years as a form of LHS. Clinically, this has largely focused on common, serious paediatric illnesses such as pneumonia, malaria and diarrhoea with dehydration with recent extensions to neonatal illnesses. CIN also enables examination of the quality of care, for example that provided to children with severe malnutrition and the challenges encountered in routine settings in adopting simple technologies (pulse oximetry) and more advanced diagnostics (eg, Xpert MTB/RIF). Although regular feedback to hospitals has been associated with some improvements in quality data continue to highlight system challenges that undermine provision of basic, quality care (eg, poor access to blood glucose testing and routine microbiology). These challenges include those associated with increased mortality risk (eg, delays in blood transfusion). Using the same data the CIN platform has enabled conduct of randomised trials and supports malaria vaccine and most recently COVID-19 surveillance. Employing LHS principles has meant engaging front-line workers, clinical managers and national stakeholders throughout. Our experience suggests LHS can be developed in low and middle-income countries that efficiently enable contextually appropriate research and contribute to strengthening of health services and research systems.</AbstractText>

The main protease (3CL) present in the new coronavirus strain is considered a potential drug target due to its role in viral replications. The plant <i>Pittosporum dasycaulon</i> Miq. is a medicinal plant reported to have prominent antimicrobial including antibacterial and antifungal activity. In this study, 12 natural compounds were selected on the basis of major peaks observed in the LC-HRMS analysis of <i>P. dasycaulon</i> aqueous leaves extract (AQLE). The pharmacological properties of the selected compounds against 3CLpro were investigated through <i>in silico</i> studies along with the standard antiviral drugs Lopinavir and Nelfinavir. The molecular docking study was done using Autodock 4.2 tool and visualized using Pymol (1.7.4.5 Edu). The docking analysis revealed that three compounds showed a better binding affinity than the standard drug Lopinavir. To validate the docking interactions, behaviour and stability of protein- ligand complex, molecular dynamics (100 ns) simulations were performed with the four best-ranked bioactive compounds identified through molecular docking analysis namely; Leptinidine, Rutaretin1'-(6″-sinapoylglucoside), Kalambroside A, and 5,7-dimethoxy', 4'methylenedioxyflavanone. The stability of the docking conformation was studied in depth by calculating the binding free energy using MM-PBSA method. Our findings on molecular docking, MD simulations and binding energy calculations suggest that Rutaretin1'-(6''-sinapoylglucoside) could be a potential inhibitor of COVID-19 3CLpro. However, considering the current pandemic situation of COVID-19, further research is required to experimentally validate their potential medicinal use against COVID-19 3CLpro both in vitro and in vivo along with clinical practices.

                <AbstractText>The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. As of 17 April 2020, more than 2 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported worldwide. Northern Italy is one of the world's centers of active coronavirus cases. In this study, we predicted the spread of COVID-19 and its burden on hospital care under different conditions of social distancing in Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna, the two regions of Italy most affected by the epidemic. To do this, we used a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) deterministic model, which encompasses compartments relevant to public health interventions such as quarantine. A new compartment L was added to the model for isolated infected population, i.e., individuals tested positives that do not need hospital care. We found that in Lombardy restrictive containment measures should be prolonged at least until early July to avoid a resurgence of hospitalizations; on the other hand, in Emilia-Romagna the number of hospitalized cases could be kept under a reasonable amount with a higher contact rate. Our results suggest that territory-specific forecasts under different scenarios are crucial to enhance or take new containment measures during the epidemic.</AbstractText>

Although computed tomography remains the gold standard for diagnosing lung diseases, its usefulness for infected, critically ill patients has been largely limited during the pandemic. Reports from those countries in which the healthcare systems were most seriously overloaded with patients with COVID-19-induced pneumonia stress the key role of point-of-care lung ultrasound performed by clinicians first during preliminary diagnostics and then while monitoring disease dynamics. This consensus, worked out by an interdisciplinary team of specialists forming the Study Group for Point-of-Care Lung Ultrasound in the Intensive Care Management of COVID-19 Patients, presents a broad spectrum of aspects regarding the analysed issue.

                <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"">The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), continues to remain a global challenge. There is emerging evidence of SARS-CoV-2 virus found in the blood of patients from China and some developed countries. However, there is inadequate data reported in Ghana and other parts of Africa, where blood transfusion service heavily relies on voluntary and replacement blood donors. This study aimed to investigate whether plasma of infected individuals could pose significant transfusion transmitted risk of COVID-19 in Ghanaian populations.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">This cross-sectional retrospective study was conducted at the Kumasi Centre for Collaborative Research into Tropical Medicine (KCCR), KNUST, Ghana. Study subjects comprised contacts of COVID-19 individuals, those with classical symptoms of COVID-19 and individuals who had recovered based on the new Ghana discharge criteria. Whole blood, sputum or deep coughed saliva samples were collected and transported to KCCR for SARS-CoV-2 testing. Viral nucleic acid was extracted from sputum/nasopharyngeal samples using Da An Gene column based kit and from plasma using LBP nucleic acid extraction kit. Real-Time PCR was performed specifically targeting the ORF1ab and Nucleocapsid (N) genomic regions of the virus.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">A total of 97 individuals were recruited into the study, with more than half being males (58; 59.7%). The mean age of all subjects was 33 years (SD = 7.7) with minimum being 22 years and maximum 56 years. Majority (76; 78.4%) of all the subjects were asymptomatic, and among the few symptomatic subjects, cough (10; 10.3%) was the most predominant symptom. Of the 97 sputum samples tested, 79 (81.4%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. We identified SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in the plasma of 1 (1.03%) subject who had clinically recovered.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">This study reports the identification of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in a convalescent individual in Ghana. Due to the low prevalence observed and the marginal cycling thresholds associated, the risk of transfusion transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is negligible. Well-powered studies and advanced diagnostics to determine infectious viremia is recommended to further evaluate the potential risk of hematogenous transmission among recovered patients.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Synthetic carbohydrate receptors (SCRs) that selectively recognize cell-surface glycans could be used for detection, drug delivery, or as therapeutics. Here we report the synthesis of seven new C<sub>2h</sub> symmetric tetrapodal SCRs. The structures of these SCRs possess a conserved biaryl core, and they vary in the four heterocyclic binding groups that are linked to the biaryl core via secondary amines. Supramolecular association between these SCRs and five biologically relevant C<sup>1</sup> -O-octyloxy glycans, α/β-glucoside (α/β-Glc), α/β-mannoside (α/β-Man), and β-galactoside (β-Gal), was studied by mass spectrometry, <sup>1</sup> H NMR titrations, and molecular modeling. These studies revealed that selectivity can be achieved in these tetrapodal SCRs by varying the heterocyclic binding group. We found that SCR017 (3-pyrrole), SCR021 (3-pyridine), and SCR022 (2-phenol) bind only to β-Glc. SCR019 (3-indole) binds only to β-Man. SCR020 (2-pyridine) binds β-Man and α-Man with a preference to the latter. SCR018 (2-indole) binds α-Man and β-Gal with a preference to the former. The glycan guests bound within their SCR hosts in one of three supramolecular geometries: center-parallel, center-perpendicular, and off-center. Many host-guest combinations formed higher stoichiometry complexes, 2:1 glycan⋅SCR or 1:2 glycan⋅SCR, where the former are driven by positive allosteric cooperativity induced by glycan-glycan contacts.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label=""Importance"">Recent studies have suggested that olfactory dysfunction and gustatory dysfunction are associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, olfaction has been evaluated solely on reported symptoms, after COVID-19 diagnosis, and in both mild and severe COVID-19 cases, but rarely has it been assessed in prospectively unselected populations.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""Objective"">To evaluate the diagnostic value of a semiobjective olfactory test developed to assess patient-reported chemosensory dysfunction prior to testing for the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in patients attending a COVID-19 screening facility.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""Design, Setting, and Participants"">This prospective diagnostic study with participants and observers blinded to COVID-19 status was conducted in a COVID-19 screening center of a tertiary university hospital in France from March 23 to April 22, 2020. Participants were 854 consecutively included health care workers or outpatients with symptoms or with close contact with an index case. Exclusion criteria were prior chemosensory dysfunction, testing inability, or contraindications (n = 45).</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""Main Outcomes and Measures"">Participants were interviewed to ascertain their symptoms and then underwent Clinical Olfactory Dysfunction Assessment (CODA), an ad hoc test developed for a simple and fast evaluation of olfactory function. This assessment followed a standardized procedure in which participants identified and rated the intensity of 3 scents (lavender, lemongrass, and mint) to achieve a summed score ranging from 0 to 6. The COVID-19 status was assessed using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in samples collected via nasopharyngeal swab (reference standard) to calculate the diagnostic values of patient-reported chemosensory dysfunction and CODA.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""Results"">Of 809 participants, the female to male sex ratio was 2.8, and the mean (SD) age was 41.8 (13.0) years (range, 18-94 years). All participants, if symptomatic, had mild disease at the time of testing, and 58 (7.2%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Chemosensory dysfunction was reported by 20 of 58 participants (34.5%) with confirmed COVID-19 vs 29 of 751 participants (3.9%) who tested negative for COVID-19 (absolute difference, 30.6% [95% CI, 18.3%-42.9%]). Olfactory dysfunction, either self-reported or clinically ascertained (CODA score ≤3), yielded similar sensitivity (0.31 [95% CI, 0.20-0.45] vs 0.34 [95% CI, 0.22-0.48]) and specificity (0.97 [95% CI, 0.96-0.98) vs 0.98 [95% CI, 0.96-0.99]) for COVID-19 diagnosis. Concordance was high between reported and clinically tested olfactory dysfunction, with a Gwet AC1 of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.93-0.97). Of 19 participants, 15 (78.9%) with both reported olfactory dysfunction and a CODA score of 3 or lower were confirmed to have COVID-19. The CODA score also revealed 5 of 19 participants (26.3%) with confirmed COVID-19 who had previously unperceived olfactory dysfunction.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""Conclusions and Relevance"">In this prospective diagnostic study of outpatients with asymptomatic or mild to moderate COVID-19, systematically assessed anamnesis and clinical testing with the newly developed CODA were complementary and specific for chemosensory dysfunction. Olfactory dysfunction was suggestive of COVID-19, particularly when clinical testing confirmed anamnesis. However, normal olfaction was most common among patients with COVID-19.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>This paper studies the social acceptability and feasibility of a focused protection strategy against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We propose a control scheme to develop herd immunity while satisfying the following two basic requirements for a viable policy option. The first requirement is social acceptability: the overall deaths should be minimized for social acceptance. The second is feasibility: the healthcare system should not be overwhelmed to avoid various adverse effects. To exploit the fact that the disease severity increases considerably with age and comorbidities, we assume that some focused protection measures for those high-risk individuals are implemented and the disease does not spread within the high-risk population. Because the protected population has higher severity ratios than the unprotected population by definition, the protective measure can substantially reduce mortality in the whole population and also avoid the collapse of the healthcare system. Based on a simple susceptible-infected-recovered model, social acceptability and feasibility of the proposed strategy are summarized into two easily computable conditions. The proposed framework can be applied to various populations for studying the viability of herd immunity strategies against COVID-19. For Japan, herd immunity may be developed by the proposed scheme if [Formula: see text] and the severity rates of the disease are 1/10 times smaller than the previously reported value, although as high mortality as seasonal influenza is expected.</AbstractText>

In a longitudinal study where 197 French citizens were surveyed over 8 weeks of confinement (though only 25 participants responded each of these 8 weeks), we examined the relationships between general self-efficacy and positive affect, negative affect and adaptive performance at work. Consistent with theoretical expectations, self-efficacy was relatively stable during confinement and was positively related to positive affect and negatively related to negative affect. Self-efficacy was also positively correlated with all dimensions of adaptive performance at work during confinement. The role of self-efficacy as a protective factor against depressive risks induced by the stressful COVID-19 pandemic is discussed.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, an outbreak occurred following attendance of a symptomatic index case at a weekly rehearsal on 10 March of the Skagit Valley Chorale (SVC). After that rehearsal, 53 members of the SVC among 61 in attendance were confirmed or strongly suspected to have contracted COVID-19 and two died. Transmission by the aerosol route is likely; it appears unlikely that either fomite or ballistic droplet transmission could explain a substantial fraction of the cases. It is vital to identify features of cases such as this to better understand the factors that promote superspreading events. Based on a conditional assumption that transmission during this outbreak was dominated by inhalation of respiratory aerosol generated by one index case, we use the available evidence to infer the emission rate of aerosol infectious quanta. We explore how the risk of infection would vary with several influential factors: ventilation rate, duration of event, and deposition onto surfaces. The results indicate a best-estimate emission rate of 970 ± 390 quanta/h. Infection risk would be reduced by a factor of two by increasing the aerosol loss rate to 5 h<sup>-1</sup> and shortening the event duration from 2.5 to 1 h.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Certain Health Workers (HWs) may have inadequate knowledge and perceptions regarding COVID-19. As a result, they may not be completely aware of the danger/risk involved, which could impact their ability to control the spread of the virus. This systematic review aims to enhance HWs' knowledge and their perception of the spread risk of COVID-19 during the pandemic. A search was conducted in four databases (Medline, CINAHL, Scopus, and ScienceDirect) to locate peer-reviewed studies published in English between January 2020 and April 2020. Eventually, nine articles satisfied the inclusion criteria and were, therefore, included in the present study. Six of the aforementioned studies specifically investigated HWs' perception of risk. Apart from a study that indicated medium perception (min = 56.5%), all other studies found high levels of risk perception (<i>n</i> = 5, max 92.1%). As for HWs' knowledge, apart from two studies that indicated medium percentage levels (min = 56.5%), the rest of the studies report high percentages (<i>n</i> = 7, max = 93.2%). Two of the studies, which assessed the sources of information that HWs use, agree that social media is the most widely used source of information. The findings of this study suggest that HWs had a satisfactory perception of risk during the spread of COVID-19. Although fields with medium knowledge levels were identified, HWs' overall knowledge may also be described as satisfactory. It is also noted that certain demographic characteristics (occupation, age, and years of experience) appear to affect HWs' knowledge and perceptions. The application of educational strategies aiming to provide continuous support to HWs is unanimously recommended by all studies.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Although the COVID-19 pandemic affects predominantly the respiratory function, epidemiological studies show that multiple systems can be affected. The severe complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection seem to be induced by an inflammatory dysregulation (""cytokine storm""), which can also induce an immunodepression. Several studies highlight beneficial effects of osteopathic medicine on inflammation and immune regulation. A careful review of evidence-based literature brings to the fore significant improvements of osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) in adjunction to conventional care. OMT can improve the condition of infected patients by decreasing symptoms and boosting the efficiency of conventional care. OMT might also benefit surviving patients by reducing the long-lasting consequences of the infection as well as improving their quality of life during convalescence. This review should constitute an argument in favor of multidisciplinary care, although further biological and clinical research is essential to better assess the potential beneficial contributions of adjunct osteopathic medicine to conventional care in the fight against pandemics such as COVID-19.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Dialysis patients are more vulnerable and susceptible to the severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection due to multiple comorbidities. Since Taiwan has the highest incidence and prevalence of treated end-stage kidney disease worldwide, it is crucial to act in advance to prevent a potential disaster. In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, we implement proactive infection control measures to prevent it from spreading without sacrificing the dialysis care quality. In this article, we focused on hemodialysis vascular access (HVA) care in particular. As a life-line of hemodialysis (HD) patients, HVA care has a profound impact on the patient's quality of dialysis and life. Specifically, in our facility, the working and office areas of the HD units are separated to reduce cross-infection. All elective procedures for HVA are postponed, and operating rooms equipped with a negative-pressure anteroom are used for the suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. Herein, we share how we modified our HVA care policy not only to prevent our patients from COVID-19 infection but also to maintain the quality of HVA care.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a life-threatening complication arising from venous thromboembolism with a difficult diagnosis and treatment and is often associated with increased mortality and morbidity. PE had a significantly low incidence prior to the COVID-19 epidemic. This condition saw a sharp surge during the COVID-19 pandemic, indicating an evident viral influence on PE's pathophysiology in COVID-19 patients. The hypercoagulable state induced by the viral load seems to be the major contributor, and the classical causative factors seem to play a lesser role. PE in COVID-19 infection has become a mammoth challenge since the diagnosis is quite challenging due to overlapping symptoms, lack of prior-known predisposing risk factors, limited resources, and viral transmittance risk. Numerous factors arising out of the viral load or treatment lead to an increased risk for PE in COVID-19 patients, besides the fact that certain unknown risk factors may also contribute to the incidence of PE in COVID-19 patients. The management of PE in COVID-19 infection mainly comprises thromboprophylaxis and anticoagulant therapy with mechanical ventilation, depending on the risk stratification of the patient, with a post-COVID-19 management that prevents recurrent PE and complications. This review aims to discuss various aspects of COVID-19-infection-associated PE and major differential aspects from non-COVID-19 PE.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is affecting millions of patients worldwide. The consequences of initial exposure to SARS-CoV-2 go beyond pulmonary damage, with a particular impact on lipid metabolism. Decreased levels in HDL-C were reported in COVID-19 patients. Since HDL particles display antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and potential anti-infectious properties, we aimed at characterizing HDL proteome and functionality during COVID-19 relative to healthy subjects. HDLs were isolated from plasma of 8 severe COVID-19 patients sampled at admission to intensive care unit (Day 1, D1) at D3 and D7, and from 16 sex- and age-matched healthy subjects. Proteomic analysis was performed by LC-MS/MS. The relative amounts of proteins identified in HDLs were compared between COVID-19 and controls. apolipoprotein A-I and paraoxonase 1 were confirmed by Western-blot analysis to be less abundant in COVID-19 versus controls, whereas serum amyloid A and alpha-1 antitrypsin were higher. HDLs from patients were less protective in endothelial cells stiumalted by TNFα (permeability, VE-cadherin disorganization and apoptosis). In these conditions, HDL inhibition of apoptosis was blunted in COVID-19 relative to controls. In conclusion, we show major changes in HDL proteome and decreased functionality in severe COVID-19 patients.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>The spread of SARS-CoV-2, along with the lack of targeted medicaments, encouraged research of existing drugs for repurposing. The rapid response to SARS-CoV-2 infection comprises a complex interaction of cytokine storm, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and pathologic coagulation. Thus, active molecules targeting multiple steps in SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle are highly wanted. Herein we explored the in silico capability of silibinin from Silybum marianum to interact with the SARS-CoV-2 main target proteins, and the in vitro effects against cytokine-induced-inflammation and dysfunction in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Computational analysis revealed that silibinin forms a stable complex with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein RBD, has good negative binding affinity with Mpro, and interacts with many residues on the active site of Mpro, thus supporting its potentiality in inhibiting viral entry and replication. Moreover, HUVECs pretreatment with silibinin reduced TNF-α-induced gene expression of the proinflammatory genes IL-6 and MCP-1, as well as of PAI-1, a critical factor in coagulopathy and thrombosis, and of ET-1, a peptide involved in hemostatic vasoconstriction. Then, due to endothelium antiinflammatory and anticoagulant properties of silibinin and its capability to interact with SARS-CoV-2 main target proteins demonstrated herein, silibinin could be a strong candidate for COVID-19 management from a multitarget perspective.</AbstractText>

Our Susceptible to the disease, Infectious, and Recovered coupled Agent Based Modelling (SIR-ABM) analysis for studying the diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 particles suggested that the trade-distancing strategy effectively reduces the reproduction number (R0). The retail shop closure strategy reduced the number of visitors to the market by nearly half. In addition, the buy-local policy option reduced the infection by more than 70% in total.

                <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"">SARS-Cov2 infection may trigger lung inflammation and acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome (ARDS) that requires active ventilation and may have fatal outcome. Considering the severity of the disease and the lack of active treatments, 14 patients with Covid-19 and severe lung inflammation received inhaled adenosine in the attempt to therapeutically compensate for the oxygen-related loss of the endogenous adenosine→A2A adenosine receptor (A2AR)-mediated mitigation of the lung-destructing inflammatory damage. This off label-treatment was based on preclinical studies in mice with LPS-induced ARDS, where inhaled adenosine/A2AR agonists protected oxygenated lungs from the deadly inflammatory damage. The treatment was allowed, considering that adenosine has several clinical applications.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""PATIENTS AND TREATMENT"">Fourteen consecutively enrolled patients with Covid19-related interstitial pneumonitis and PaO2/FiO2 ratio&lt;300 received off-label-treatment with 9 mg inhaled adenosine every 12 hours in the first 24 hours and subsequently, every 24 days for the next 4 days. Fifty-two patients with analogue features and hospitalized between February and April 2020, who did not receive adenosine, were considered as a historical control group. Patients monitoring also included hemodynamic/hematochemical studies, CTscans, and SARS-CoV2-tests.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">The treatment was well tolerated with no hemodynamic change and one case of moderate bronchospasm. A significant increase (&gt; 30%) in the PaO2/FiO2-ratio was reported in 13 out of 14 patients treated with adenosine compared with that observed in 7 out of52 patients in the control within 15 days. Additionally, we recorded a mean PaO2/FiO2-ratio increase (215 ± 45 vs. 464 ± 136, P = 0.0002) in patients receiving adenosine and no change in the control group (210±75 vs. 250±85 at 120 hours, P&gt;0.05). A radiological response was demonstrated in 7 patients who received adenosine, while SARS-CoV-2 RNA load rapidly decreased in 13 cases within 7 days while no changes were recorded in the control group within 15 days. There was one Covid-19 related death in the experimental group and 11in the control group.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label=""OBJECTIVES"">The disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, known as coronavirus disease 2019, has resulted in a global pandemic. Reports are emerging of a new severe hyperinflammatory syndrome related to coronavirus disease 2019 in children and adolescents. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has designated this disease multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Our objective was to develop a clinical inpatient protocol for the evaluation, management, and follow-up of patients with this syndrome.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""DATA SOURCES"">The protocol was developed by a multidisciplinary team based on relevant literature related to coronavirus disease 2019, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, and related inflammatory syndromes, as well as our experience caring for children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Data were obtained on patients with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children at our institution from the pre-protocol and post-protocol periods.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""DATA SYNTHESIS"">Our protocol was developed in order to identify cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children with high sensitivity, stratify risk to guide treatment, recognize co-infectious or co-inflammatory processes, mitigate coronary artery abnormalities, and manage hyperinflammatory shock. Key elements of evaluation include case identification using broad clinical characteristics and comprehensive laboratory and imaging investigations. Treatment centers around glucocorticoids and IV immunoglobulin with biologic immunomodulators as adjuncts. Multidisciplinary follow-up after discharge is indicated to manage continued outpatient therapy and evaluate for disease sequelae. In nearly 2 months, we admitted 54 patients with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, all of whom survived without the need for invasive ventilatory or mechanical circulatory support. After institution of this protocol, patients received earlier treatment and had shorter lengths of hospital stay.</AbstractText>

However, according to several reports, RT-PCR showed a low sensitivity and multiple tests may be required to rule out false negative results. Recently, chest computed tomography (CT) has been an efficient tool to diagnose COVID-19 as it is directly affecting the lungs. In this paper, we investigate the application of pre-trained models in diagnosing patients who are positive for COVID-19 and differentiating it from normal patients, who tested negative for coronavirus. The study aims to compare the generalization capabilities of deep learning models with two thoracic radiologists in diagnosing COVID-19 chest CT images. A dataset of 3000 images was obtained from the Near East Hospital, Cyprus, and used to train and to test the three employed pre-trained models. In a test set of 250 images used to evaluate the deep neural networks and the radiologists, it was found that deep networks (ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and DenseNet-201) can outperform the radiologists in terms of higher accuracy (97.8%), sensitivity (98.1%), specificity (97.3%), precision (98.4%), and F1-score (198.25%), in classifying COVID-19 images.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2021 Abdulkader Helwan et al.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>",0,2021-06-03 00:00:00

                <AbstractText>The COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown have been associated with multiple consequences for mental health, including an excessive and potentially harmful increase in screen media use. The specific consequences for children, adolescents and young adults with ADHD are still unknown. In the first part of this study, a short review of problematic use of the internet (PUI) in ADHD is presented, showing that patients with ADHD are at risk for different aspects of PUI, such as excessive gaming or problematic social media use. In the second part, we report original data of an online survey on screen media use before, during and after the lockdown completed by parents of children and adolescents clinically referred for ADHD. Parents rated children's/adolescents' media-related behavior and media time on a new screening questionnaire for PUI. Each item was rated three times, referring to the observed behavior before, during and 1-2 months after the lockdown. N = 126 parents of patients referred for ADHD aged 10-18 years participated in the study. Total media time increased by 46% during the lockdown and did not completely return to pre-Corona levels afterwards. Patients with difficulties concentrating, high irritability or deterioration of ADHD problems under lockdown spent more time with screen media than those with milder or no such problems. While the effects of the lockdown on screen media use and its negative impact on everyday life appear to be largely reversible, a small proportion of patients with ADHD apparently continue to show increased media use.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Many GI training programs have needed to adjust to the serious disruption to the training and education of fellows worldwide due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A silent problem that has arisen within programs is the issue of burnout among their trainees. Burnout is common among gastroenterologists, especially in fellows (Keswani et al. in Gastroenterology 147(1):11-14, 2014. https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2014.05.023 , Am J Gastroenterol 106(10):1734-1740, 2011. https://doi.org/10.1038/ajg.2011.148 ), with negative consequences to patient care and the safety of the trainees if not effectively dealt with. In this article, the author describes several additional factors potentially contributing to the intensifying burnout of the fellows in their home institution during this pandemic. Moreover, he describes specific practical interventions that the hospital and program have taken in order to address these factors.</AbstractText>

To date, four vaccines have been approved by European and American authorities for preventing COVID-19 but the development of additional vaccine platforms with improved supply and logistics profiles remains a pressing need. Here we report the preclinical evaluation of a novel COVID-19 vaccine candidate based on the electroporation of engineered, synthetic cDNA encoding a viral antigen in the skeletal muscle. We constructed a set of prototype DNA vaccines expressing various forms of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein and assessed their immunogenicity in animal models. Among them, COVID-eVax - a DNA plasmid encoding a secreted monomeric form of SARS-CoV-2 S protein RBD - induced the most potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody responses (including against the current most common variants of concern) and a robust T cell response. Upon challenge with SARS-CoV-2, immunized K18-hACE2 transgenic mice showed reduced weight loss, improved pulmonary function and lower viral replication in the lungs and brain. COVID-eVax conferred significant protection to ferrets upon SARS-CoV-2 challenge. In summary, this study identifies COVID-eVax as an ideal COVID-19 vaccine candidate suitable for clinical development. Accordingly, a combined phase I-II trial has recently started.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2021.

                <AbstractText>The human serine protease serine 2 TMPRSS2 is involved in the priming of proteins of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and represents a possible target for COVID-19 therapy. The TMPRSS2 gene may be co-expressed with SARS-CoV-2 cell receptor genes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Basigin (BSG), but only TMPRSS2 demonstrates tissue-specific expression in alveolar cells according to single-cell RNA sequencing data. Our analysis of the structural variability of the TMPRSS2 gene based on genome-wide data from 76 human populations demonstrates that a functionally significant missense mutation in exon 6/7 in the TMPRSS2 gene is found in many human populations at relatively high frequencies, with region-specific distribution patterns. The frequency of the missense mutation encoded by rs12329760, which has previously been found to be associated with prostate cancer, ranged between 10% and 63% and was significantly higher in populations of Asian origin compared with European populations. In addition to single-nucleotide polymorphisms, two copy number variants were detected in the TMPRSS2 gene. A number of microRNAs have been predicted to regulate TMPRSS2 and BSG expression levels, but none of them is enriched in lung or respiratory tract cells. Several well-studied drugs can downregulate the expression of TMPRSS2 in human cells, including acetaminophen (paracetamol) and curcumin. Thus, the interactions of TMPRSS2 with SARS-CoV-2, together with its structural variability, gene-gene interactions, expression regulation profiles, and pharmacogenomic properties, characterize this gene as a potential target for COVID-19 therapy.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province and has rapidly spread all over the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 01/30/2020 and recognized it as a pandemic on 03/11/2020. The number of people diagnosed with COVID-19 worldwide crossed the one million mark on 04/02/2020; two million mark on 04/15/2020; three million mark on 04/27/2020 and the four million mark on 05/09/2020. Despite containment efforts, more than 187 countries have been affected with more than 4,178,346 cases in the world with maximum being in USA (1,347,936) followed by 227,436 in Spain and 224,422 in United Kingdom as of May, 2020. COVID-19 is the latest threat to face mankind cutting across geographical barriers in a rapidly changing landscape. This review provides an update on a rapidly evolving global pandemic. As we face the threat of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, this is a stark reminder to invest in population health, climate change countermeasures, a global health surveillance system and effective research into identifying pathogens, their treatment and prevention and effective health delivery systems.</AbstractText>

This disease is easily spreadable from one person to another even with minimal contact, even more for the latest mutations that are more deadly than its predecessor. Hence, COVID-19 needs to be diagnosed as early as possible to minimize the risk of spreading among the community. However, the laboratory results on the approved diagnosis method by the World Health Organization, the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test, takes around a day to be processed, where a longer period is observed in the developing countries. Therefore, a fast screening method that is based on existing facilities should be developed to complement this diagnosis test, so that a suspected patient can be isolated in a quarantine center. In line with this motivation, deep learning techniques were explored to provide an automated COVID-19 screening system based on X-ray imaging. This imaging modality is chosen because of its low-cost procedures that are widely available even in many small clinics. A new convolutional neural network (CNN) model is proposed instead of utilizing pre-trained networks of the existing models. The proposed network, Residual-Shuffle-Net, comprises four stacks of the residual-shuffle unit followed by a spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) unit. The architecture of the residual-shuffle unit follows an hourglass design with reduced convolution filter size in the middle layer, where a shuffle operation is performed right after the split branches have been concatenated back. Shuffle operation forces the network to learn multiple sets of features relationship across various channels instead of a set of global features. The SPP unit, which is placed at the end of the network, allows the model to learn multi-scale features that are crucial to distinguish between the COVID-19 and other types of pneumonia cases. The proposed network is benchmarked with 12 other state-of-the-art CNN models that have been designed and tuned specially for COVID-19 detection. The experimental results show that the Residual-Shuffle-Net produced the best performance in terms of accuracy and specificity metrics with 0.97390 and 0.98695, respectively. The model is also considered as a lightweight model with slightly more than 2 million parameters, which makes it suitable for mobile-based applications. For future work, an attention mechanism can be integrated to target certain regions of interest in the X-ray images that are deemed to be more informative for COVID-19 diagnosis.</AbstractText></Abstract>",0,2021-08-30 00:00:00

We collected data from three external ED sites in the Atrium Health system between March 15th and April 15th, 2020. Patients were included if they were seen at one of the sites and tested for COVID-19. There were no exclusion criteria. We analyzed the data to identify any differences in patient demographics between sites.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">We saw 580 patients across the three sites, 302 of whom met criteria for COVID-19 testing. The majority of patients tested were Caucasian females. The majority who tested positive, however, were males. Thirteen patients were redirected into the hospital ED for further medical evaluation.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">External expansion of the ED is an important strategy that can allow hospitals to accommodate potentially infectious patients while maintaining appropriate isolation and rapid throughput. Proper implementation of the right system to meet hospital-specific needs can prove effective for the healthcare system.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"">Chile has become one of the countries most affected by COVID-19, a pandemic that has generated a large number of cases worldwide. If not detected and treated in time, COVID-19 can cause multi-organ failure and even death. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the behavior of the spread of COVID-19 as well as the projection of infections and deaths. This information is very relevant so that public health organizations can distribute financial resources efficiently and take appropriate containment measures. In this research, we compare different time series methodologies to predict the number of confirmed cases of and deaths from COVID-19 in Chile.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">The methodology used in this research consisted of modeling cases of both confirmed diagnoses and deaths from COVID-19 in Chile using Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA henceforth) models, Exponential Smoothing techniques, and Poisson models for time-dependent count data. Additionally, we evaluated the accuracy of the predictions using a training set and a test set.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">The dataset used in this research indicated that the most appropriate model is the ARIMA time series model for predicting the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, whereas for predicting the number of deaths from COVID-19 in Chile, the most suitable approach is the damped trend method.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">The ARIMA models are an alternative to modeling the behavior of the spread of COVID-19; however, depending on the characteristics of the dataset, other methodologies can better predict the behavior of these records, for example, the Holt-Winter method implemented with time-dependent count data.</AbstractText>

This article focuses on the association between dental plaque and COVID-19 concerning the influence of altered oral biofilm on the risk of increased severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, it concentrates on the usefulness of propolis, with its apitherapeutic antibacterial properties, for treating oral bacterial infections co-occurring with SARS-CoV-2 infection. A review of the literature on PubMed, Cochrane Library and Medline between 2000 and 2021 revealed 56 published articles indicating that a link between dental plaque and COVID-19 complications was probable. Furthermore, they indicated that propolis may minimize COVID-19 severity by reducing dental plaque accumulation. The possibility that improved oral health could reduce the risk of COVID-19 complications should be of interest to scientists.</AbstractText></Abstract>",0,2021-09-28 00:00:00

                <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"">Patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) often have abnormal findings on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). However, although not all abnormalities on TTE result in changes in clinical management, performing TTE in recently infected patients increases disease transmission risks. It remains unknown whether common biomarker tests, such as troponin and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), can help distinguish in which patients with COVID-19 TTE may be safely delayed until infection risks subside.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">Using electronic health records data and chart review, the authors retrospectively studied all patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in a multisite health care system from March 1, 2020, to January 15, 2021, who underwent TTE within 14 days of their first positive COVID-19 result and had BNP and troponin measured before or within 7 days of TTE. The primary outcome was the presence of one or more urgent echocardiographic findings, defined as left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 35%, wall motion score index ≥ 1.5, moderate or greater right ventricular dysfunction, moderate or greater pericardial effusion, intracardiac thrombus, pulmonary artery systolic pressure &gt; 50 mm Hg, or at least moderate to severe valvular disease. Stepwise logistic regression was conducted to determine biomarkers and comorbidities associated with the outcome. The performance of a rule for classifying TTE using troponin and BNP was evaluated.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">Four hundred thirty-four hospitalized and 151 intensive care unit patients with COVID-19 were included. Urgent findings on TTE were present in 105 patients (24.2%). Troponin and BNP were abnormal in 311 (71.7%). Heart failure (odds ratio, 5.41; 95% CI, 2.61-11.68), troponin &gt; 0.04 ng/mL (odds ratio, 4.40; 95% CI, 2.05-10.05), and BNP &gt; 100 pg/mL (odds ratio, 5.85; 95% CI, 2.35-16.09) remained significant predictors of urgent findings on TTE after stepwise selection. No urgent findings on TTE were seen in 95.1% of all patients and in 91.3% of intensive care unit patients with normal troponin and BNP.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Troponin and BNP were highly associated with urgent echocardiographic findings and may be used in triaging algorithms for determining in which patients TTE can be safely delayed until after their peak infectious window has passed.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Ibuprofen is an over-the-counter medication that is used widely for the treatment of pain and fever during COVID-19 pandemic. A concern was raised regarding the safety of ibuprofen use because of its role in increasing ACE2 levels within the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone system. ACE2 is the coreceptor for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells, and so, a potential increased risk of contracting COVID-19 disease and/or worsening of COVID-19 infection was feared with ibuprofen use. However, available data from limited studies show administration of recombinant ACE2 improves lung damage caused by respiratory viruses, suggesting ibuprofen use may be beneficial in COVID-19 disease. At this time, there is no supporting evidence to discourage the use of ibuprofen.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>COVID-19 (also known as SARS-COV-2) pandemic has spread in the entire world. It is a contagious disease that easily spreads from one person in direct contact to another, classified by experts in five categories: asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe, and critical. Already more than 66 million people got infected worldwide with more than 22 million active patients as of 5 December 2020 and the rate is accelerating. More than 1.5 million patients (approximately 2.5% of total reported cases) across the world lost their life. In many places, the COVID-19 detection takes place through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests which may take longer than 48 h. This is one major reason of its severity and rapid spread. We propose in this paper a two-phase X-ray image classification called XCOVNet for early COVID-19 detection using convolutional neural Networks model. XCOVNet detects COVID-19 infections in chest X-ray patient images in two phases. The first phase pre-processes a dataset of 392 chest X-ray images of which half are COVID-19 positive and half are negative. The second phase trains and tunes the neural network model to achieve a 98.44% accuracy in patient classification.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"">The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly affected all facets of everyday life including the practice of medicine. Hospital systems and medical practices have evolved to protect patients, physicians, and staff and conserve personal protective equipment and resources. Orthopaedic practices have been specifically affected by social distancing and stay at home guidelines, limiting in-office practice and elective surgery restrictions. This, in turn, has had an effect on resident education. Previous literature has been published regarding how academic programs have adjusted to these changes. However, the effects on smaller orthopaedic residencies with nonacademic faculty has not been discussed. The orthopaedic residency at Baylor University Medical Center of Dallas is a fifteen-resident program with a combination of hospital employed and private practice faculty. We adjusted our resident education in mid-March 2020 to keep residents safe while trying to maximize surgical and clinical education and outside research.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""GOALS"">Our goals were to come up with a plan allowed for continuing high-level patient care and resident education while protecting residents and limiting burnout.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""MODEL"">We devised a four-team system with five-day call periods. Interactions between teams were strictly minimized. We also moved to a web-based academic curriculum and devised a system for safe resident participation in surgical cases. The model has been adjusted based on attending and resident feedback.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">Until we develop effective treatments or vaccination for COVID-19, there is a possibility that it will be an ongoing threat. Resident education must also adapt to the changing environment while continuing to provide residents safe opportunities for patient care, didactic education, and research. We believe we have come up with a sustainable, adaptable model for resident education during this challenging time.</AbstractText>

Currently, most SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) clinical testing is voluntary and inconsistently available, except for a few occupational and educational settings, and therefore likely underrepresents actual population prevalence. Randomized testing on a regular basis to estimate accurate population-level infection rates is prohibitively costly and is hampered by a range of limitations and barriers associated with participation in clinical research. In comparison, community-level fecal monitoring can be performed through wastewater surveillance to effectively surveil communities. However, epidemiologically defined protocols for wastewater sample site selection are lacking. Herein, we describe methods for developing a geographically resolved population-level wastewater sampling approach in Jefferson County, Kentucky, and present preliminary results. Utilizing this site selection protocol, samples (<i>n</i> = 237) were collected from 17 wastewater catchment areas, September 8 to October 30, 2020 from one to four times per week in each area and compared to concurrent clinical data aggregated to wastewater catchment areas and county level. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was consistently present in wastewater during the studied period, and varied by area. Data obtained using the site selection protocol showed variation in geographically resolved wastewater SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration compared to clinical rates. These findings highlight the importance of neighborhood-equivalent spatial scales and provide a promising approach for viral epidemic surveillance, thus better guiding spatially targeted public health mitigation strategies.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>© 2021.

                <AbstractText>As mobile device location data become increasingly available, new analyses are revealing the significant changes of mobility pattern when an unplanned event happened. With different control policies from local and state government, the COVID-19 outbreak has dramatically changed mobility behavior in affected cities. This study has been investigating the impact of COVID-19 on the number of people involved in crashes accounting for the intensity of different control measures using Negative Binomial (NB) method. Based on a comprehensive dataset of people involved in crashes aggregated in New York City during January 1, 2020 to May 24, 2020, people involved in crashes with respect to travel behavior, traffic characteristics and socio-demographic characteristics are found. The results show that the average person miles traveled on the main traffic mode per person per day, percentage of work trip have positive effect on person involved in crashes. On the contrary, unemployment rate and inflation rate have negative effects on person involved in crashes. Interestingly, different level of control policies during COVID-19 outbreak are closely associated with safety awareness, driving and travel behavior, and thus has an indirect influence on the frequency of crashes. Comparing to other three control policies including emergence declare, limits on mass gatherings, and ban on all nonessential gathering, the negative relationship between stay-at-home policy implemented in New York City from March 20, 2020 and the number of people involved crashes is found in our study.</AbstractText>

We employed a case study design, taking a case study of adolescents currently under the care of Uganda Youth Development Link (UYDEL). The data analyzed were collected from 219 female and male adolescents (13-19 years) recruited through UYDEL in Kampala, Uganda. A Poisson regression model with robust variance was used to assess the risk factors associated with suicidality. The prevalence of suicidal ideation in the past 4 weeks and attempt within the past 6 months among adolescents was 30.6% (95% CI: 24.8, 38.0%) and 24.2% (95% CI: 18.7, 30.4%), respectively. The most stressful precursors of suicidal ideation or attempt included financial difficulties (59.5%), family breakdown or conflicts (37.4%), and trauma (23.1%). Suicidal ideation in the past 1 week preceding the survey was as high as 13.3% (95% CI: 9.0, 18.6%), of which 75.0% (95% CI: 55.1%, 89.3%) had a suicide plan. Prevalence of suicidal ideation in the past 4 weeks was significantly higher among respondents with moderate psychological distress [Prevalence Ratio (PRR) = 2.74; 95% CI: 0.96, 7.84] and severe psychological distress (PRR = 4.75; 95% CI: 1.72, 13.08) but lower among adolescents who knew where to obtain professional psychological care (PRR = 0.51; 95% CI: 0.30, 0.87). Similarly, suicidal attempt was significantly higher among respondents with moderate psychological distress (PRR = 4.72; 95% CI: 1.01, 12.03) and severe psychological distress (PRR = 11.8; 95% CI: 4.66, 32.37), and who abuse drugs or substances (PRR = 2.13; 95% CI: 1.13, 4.01). Therefore, suicidal ideation is a major public health issue among adolescents living in poor urban settlements in Kampala, Uganda. Psychological distress due to financial difficulties, unemployment, and family breakdown are major facilitators of suicidality among adolescents in urban poor settlements in Kampala. Interventions aimed at preventing suicide among vulnerable adolescents in urban settlements in Kampala, Uganda should incorporate this unique risk factor profile.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2021 Bukuluki, Wandiembe, Kisaakye, Besigwa and Kasirye.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>",0,2021-08-10 00:00:00

                <AbstractText>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has rapidly spread, resulting in considerable casualties and serious economic loss worldwide. Disease severity and related symptoms markedly vary among individuals. A large number of patients present atypical symptoms, which represent a big challenge for early diagnosis and prompt infection source isolation. Currently, COVID-19 diagnosis predominantly depends on nucleic acid tests (NAT) for SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimens, but this method presents a high rate of false negative results. Therefore, serum antibody measurement has been rapidly developed as a supplementary method with the aim of improving diagnostic accuracy. Further, serum antibody levels might help to identify the infection stage, asymptomatic carriers, and patients with diverging severities and to monitor convalescent plasma therapy. In the current review, we aim to present comprehensive evidence to clarify the utility of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in COVID-19 patients as a reference for use in the clinic.</AbstractText>

Crisis management in medicine has often been likened to crisis management in the aviation industry. The important difference between pilots and clinicians being that the clinician's life was not in imminent danger, should one fail. The clinician did not have the same emotional urgency as the pilot. The COVID-19 pandemic has changed this, clinicians are now faced with the need to make urgent decisions whilst exposed to some personal risk. Whether to embrace POCUS and lung ultrasound during this pandemic is an important decision. Whilst there are clear advantages, poorly considered overzealous uptake it is not without hazard, opportunity cost and potential risk to patient and clinician.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label=""RESULT"">We included 465 consecutive COVID-19 critically ill patients. The majority (67.1%) of the patients were older than 60 years, with a median (IQR) age of 69 (56.5-75); 240 (51.6%) were male. At 60 days of follow-up, 184 (39.6%) were discharged alive, while 281 (60.4%) died in the intensive care unit. The median (IQR) ICU length of stay was 7 days (4-10) and non-survivors had significantly shorter stay, 6 (3-10) days. The body mass index was 27.9 (24.1-31.6) kg/m2. At admission to the intensive care unit, quick SOFA median (IQR) score was 1 (1-2), whereas total SOFA score was 6 (4-7). In univariate analysis, the following parameters were significantly associated with increased/decreased hazard of mortality: increased age, BMI, white cell count, neutrophils, procalcitonin, cardiac troponin, C-reactive protein, ferritin, fibrinogen, prothrombin, and d-dimer levels were associated with higher risk of mortality. Decreased lymphocytes, and platelet count were associated with higher risk of mortality. Quick SOFA and total SOFA scores increase, emergency intubation, inotrope use, stress myocardiopathy, acute kidney injury, arrythmia, and seizure were associated with higher mortality.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">Our study reported the highest mortality rate (60.4%) among critically ill patients with COVID-19 60 days post-ICU admission.

SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of COVID-19 [1], primarily affects the respiratory system leading to respiratory illnesses of varying severity ranging from mild flu-like symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome [2]. However, the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are not limited to the respiratory system [3]. There is a growing body of literature showing the incidence of a varying clinical spectrum of neuropsychiatric manifestations in a significant proportion of COVID-19 patients [4]. With the variability in neuropsychiatric presentation of COVID- 19, multiple mechanisms have been proposed to explain the pathophysiology of these presentations [5].

The use of minimally invasive DBS sampling provides an alternative to existing analytical procedures such as sampling by venipuncture or nasal swabs. Due to the ease of DBS collection, no third party need be involved, making at-home sampling possible (e.g., during quarantine).</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV2, can cause a potentially fatal disease, COVID-19, in humans. Here, we will provide an overview of therapeutic options for COVID-19. Plasma from patients recovered from COVID-19 that contains antibodies against SARS-CoV2 has shown promising results in patients with severe COVID-19. Also, IVIG, combined with moderate-dose of corticosteroids, might improve patient outcomes. Evidence links COVID-19 to variable degrees of inflammation. Studies show that the use of corticosteroids might accelerate recovery from COVID-19. There are, however, no controlled clinical trials that show whether the use of corticosteroids can reduce COVID-19-related death. Also, the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL6 is the best-documented cytokine in COVID-19 correlated with severity, criticality, viral load, and prognosis of patients with COVID-19. Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against IL6, could confer clinical benefit in patients with high IL6 levels. Essential elements that process SARS-CoV2 cell entry and specific characteristics that allow SARS-CoV2 to escape the immune system have the potential as targets for COVID-19 therapy.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has a wide spectrum of disease severity from mild upper respiratory symptoms to respiratory failure. The role of neutralizing antibody (NAb) response in disease progression remains elusive. This study determined the seroprevalence of 733 non-COVID-19 individuals from April 2018 to February 2020 in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and compared the neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses of eight COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with those of 42 patients not admitted to the ICU. We found that NAb against SARS-CoV-2 was not detectable in any of the anonymous serum specimens from the 733 non-COVID-19 individuals. The peak serum geometric mean NAb titer was significantly higher among the eight ICU patients than the 42 non-ICU patients (7280 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1468-36099]) vs (671 [95% CI, 368-1223]). Furthermore, NAb titer increased significantly at earlier infection stages among ICU patients than among non-ICU patients. The median number of days to reach the peak Nab titers after symptoms onset was shorter among the ICU patients (17.6) than that of the non-ICU patients (20.1). Multivariate analysis showed that oxygen requirement and fever during admission were the only clinical factors independently associated with higher NAb titers. Our data suggested that SARS-CoV-2 was unlikely to have silently spread before the COVID-19 emergence in Hong Kong. ICU patients had an accelerated and augmented NAb response compared to non-ICU patients, which was associated with disease severity. Further studies are required to understand the relationship between high NAb response and disease severity.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label=""Introduction"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">The mental health of the health care professionals is more likely to be affected by the coronavirus disease-19 compared to the general population. Accordingly, the current study aimed to summarize the magnitudes and determinants of the psychological impact of coronavirus among health care professionals.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""Methods"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">The studies from Medline via PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar were searched from 5 September to 19 October 2020. The review was conducted as per PRISMA-2009 (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses).</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""Result"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">Initially, 6316 articles were searched from three databases (PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar). Finally, 20 articles were filtered to be included in our review. Among different types of psychological impact, stress was reported that lies within the range from 5.2% to 100%, anxiety was reported from 11.1% to 100%, depression was from 10.6% to 58%, and insomnia was from 28.75% to 34%. Several factors were related to the negative psychological state of health care workers due to coronavirus disease-19 like educational level, occupation, gender, age, working environment, work experience, legal status, ethnicity, psychological comorbidity, social support, personal/family exposure, and feeling of health care providers.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""Conclusion"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">The most common psychological impacts among health care workers were anxiety and stress. Besides different sociodemographic factors that determine the psychological impacts, front-line health care workers and participants having psychological comorbidity have a high risk of negative psychological state impacts as compared to their counterparts. Therefore, special attention should tend to health care workers directly involved in the prevention and management of coronavirus disease-19 and having a different risk of mental health condition.</AbstractText>

Revue internationale de pedagogie,Netherlands,Public health crises compounded: A high school equivalency context in the time of a pandemic.,"Isaiah Zukowski, Zachary Parker, Daisy Shetterly, Kimberly Valle","<Abstract>
                <AbstractText>High school equivalency (HSE) is a recognised alternative to a high school diploma in the United States. It offers an opportunity to a range of disadvantaged adult learners such as school dropouts, refugees etc. to attain an educational certificate enabling them to move on in their life. This article presents an autoethnographic case study of a non-profit HSE programme in Philadelphia during the COVID-19 pandemic. The four authors of this article, all of them instructors on the front line of the youth crisis in adult education, explore the broader context of non-governmental organisation (NGO) management and privatised HSE exams. In their research and their reflections, they found that the pandemic exacerbated existing economic and social inequalities, with both pre-pandemic and current delivery of their HSE programme failing to address the survival needs of a population which has long been living in crisis. Juxtaposing relevant youth-in-crisis literature with narratives both from before the pandemic and whilst living through it, the authors of this article discuss the funding and institutional constraints around the environment in which they teach. Their case study sheds light on competing priorities within the non-profit education landscape, highlighting both pitfalls and successes in HSE curriculum and administration. The authors conclude that rapid adaptation to online teaching tools, platforms and products is not the panacea that many outcomes generators would like it to be.</AbstractText>

Apart from the clinically and electrocardiographically discernible causes of ACI, such as acute myocardial infarction (MI), other cardiac causes need to be considered such as myocarditis, Takotsubo syndrome, and direct injury from COVID-19, together with noncardiac conditions, such as pulmonary embolism, critical illness, and sepsis. Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) with normal or near-normal coronary arteries (ACS-NNOCA) appear to have a higher prevalence in both COVID-19 positive and negative patients in the pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic era. Echocardiography, coronary angiography, chest computed tomography and/or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging may render a correct diagnosis, obviating the need for endomyocardial biopsy. Importantly, a significant delay has been recorded in patients with ACS seeking advice for their symptoms, while their routine care has been sharply disrupted with fewer urgent coronary angiographies and/or primary percutaneous coronary interventions performed in the case of ST-elevation MI (STEMI) with an inappropriate shift toward thrombolysis, all contributing to a higher complication rate in these patients. Thus, new challenges have emerged in rendering a diagnosis and delivering treatment in patients with ACI/ACS in the pandemic era. These issues, the various mechanisms involved in the development of ACI/ACS, and relevant current guidelines are herein reviewed.</AbstractText></Abstract>",0,2021-07-21 00:00:00

In severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) the alteration of coagulation parameters was associated with poor prognosis. We evaluated the difference in coagulopathy between critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (COVID group) and non-COVID-19 pneumonia (non-COVID group), using traditional coagulation markers and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM). Standard laboratory and ROTEM parameters were evaluated in 45 patients (20 COVID group patients and 25 non-COVID group patients) at time of admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) (T0) and at 5 (T5) and 10 days (T10) later. In all evaluations times, platelet count was found higher in COVID group rather than in non-COVID group. At T0, COVID group revealed a fibrinogen value greater than non-COVID group. d-Dimer values were high in both groups and they were not statistically different. At T0 COVID group showed a significant reduction of clot formation time in INTEM and in EXTEM and a significant increase of maximum clot firmness in INTEM, EXTEM and FIBTEM respect to non-COVID group. Moreover, COVID group demonstrated a coagulability state with ROTEM profiles higher than non-COVID group at T5 and T10. Coagulation profiles showed that critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia are characterized by a higher coagulable state than others; this greater procoagulative state persists over time.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>During the first 6-months of the COVID-19 pandemic, the primary weapons against the spread of the virus have included local government orders for restriction of movement and broad implementation of face masks and social distancing policies. While some early reports suggested increases in loneliness during the pandemic restrictions, others reported no changes. Here, we provide an update on self-reported loneliness over the first 6-months of community lockdown restrictions from a nationwide sample of 6,186 U.S. adults who completed the UCLA Loneliness Scale-3 and Public Health Questionnaire-9 during the pandemic. Loneliness scores increased significantly from April through September 2020 and were significantly higher for those reporting they were under stay-at-home, shelter-in-place, or lockdown orders compared to those reporting no restrictions. Greater loneliness was positively correlated with depression and suicidal ideation. Loneliness has increased over the first half-year of the pandemic, particularly for those under lockdown restrictions, and remains a significant mental health concern.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2), represents a major challenge for healthcare. The involvement of cardiovascular system in COVID‑19 has been proven and increased healthcare system resources are redirected towards handling infected patients, which induces major changes in access to services and prioritization in the management of patients with chronic cardiovascular disease unrelated to COVID‑19. In this expert opinion, conceived by the task force involving the Working Groups on Valvular Heart Diseases and Cardiac Surgery as well as the Association of Cardiovascular Intervention of the Polish Cardiac Society, modification of diagnostic pathways, principles of healthcare personnel protection, and treatment guidelines regarding triage and prioritization are suggested. Heart Teams responsible for the treatment of valvular heart disease should continue their work using telemedicine and digital technology. Diagnostic tests must be simplified or deferred to minimize the number of potentially dangerous aerosol‑generating procedures, such as transesophageal echocardiography or exercise imaging. The treatment of aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation has to be offered particularly due to urgent indications and in patients with advanced disease and poor prognosis. Expert risk stratification is essential for triage and setting the priority lists. In each case, an appropriate level of personal protection must be ensured for the healthcare personnel to prevent spreading infection and preserve specialized manpower, who will supply the continuing need for handling serious chronic cardiovascular disease. Importantly, as soon as the local epidemic situation improves, efforts must be made to restore standard opportunities for elective treatment of valvular heart disease and occluder‑based therapies according to existing guidelines, thus rebuilding the state ‑of ‑the ‑art cardiovascular services.</AbstractText>

Infectious diseases,United States,The temporal association of introducing and lifting non-pharmaceutical interventions with the time-varying reproduction number (R) of SARS-CoV-2: a modelling study across 131 countries.,"You Li, Harry Campbell, Durga Kulkarni, Alice Harpur, Madhurima Nundy, Xin Wang, Harish Nair,  ","<Abstract>
                <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"">Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were implemented by many countries to reduce the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causal agent of COVID-19. A resurgence in COVID-19 cases has been reported in some countries that lifted some of these NPIs. We aimed to understand the association of introducing and lifting NPIs with the level of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, as measured by the time-varying reproduction number (R), from a broad perspective across 131 countries.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">In this modelling study, we linked data on daily country-level estimates of R from the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine (London, UK) with data on country-specific policies on NPIs from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker, available between Jan 1 and July 20, 2020. We defined a phase as a time period when all NPIs remained the same, and we divided the timeline of each country into individual phases based on the status of NPIs. We calculated the R ratio as the ratio between the daily R of each phase and the R from the last day of the previous phase (ie, before the NPI status changed) as a measure of the association between NPI status and transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We then modelled the R ratio using a log-linear regression with introduction and relaxation of each NPI as independent variables for each day of the first 28 days after the change in the corresponding NPI. In an ad-hoc analysis, we estimated the effect of reintroducing multiple NPIs with the greatest effects, and in the observed sequence, to tackle the possible resurgence of SARS-CoV-2.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""FINDINGS"">790 phases from 131 countries were included in the analysis. A decreasing trend over time in the R ratio was found following the introduction of school closure, workplace closure, public events ban, requirements to stay at home, and internal movement limits; the reduction in R ranged from 3% to 24% on day 28 following the introduction compared with the last day before introduction, although the reduction was significant only for public events ban (R ratio 0·76, 95% CI 0·58-1·00); for all other NPIs, the upper bound of the 95% CI was above 1. An increasing trend over time in the R ratio was found following the relaxation of school closure, bans on public events, bans on public gatherings of more than ten people, requirements to stay at home, and internal movement limits; the increase in R ranged from 11% to 25% on day 28 following the relaxation compared with the last day before relaxation, although the increase was significant only for school reopening (R ratio 1·24, 95% CI 1·00-1·52) and lifting bans on public gatherings of more than ten people (1·25, 1·03-1·51); for all other NPIs, the lower bound of the 95% CI was below 1. It took a median of 8 days (IQR 6-9) following the introduction of an NPI to observe 60% of the maximum reduction in R and even longer (17 days [14-20]) following relaxation to observe 60% of the maximum increase in R. In response to a possible resurgence of COVID-19, a control strategy of banning public events and public gatherings of more than ten people was estimated to reduce R, with an R ratio of 0·71 (95% CI 0·55-0·93) on day 28, decreasing to 0·62 (0·47-0·82) on day 28 if measures to close workplaces were added, 0·58 (0·41-0·81) if measures to close workplaces and internal movement restrictions were added, and 0·48 (0·32-0·71) if measures to close workplaces, internal movement restrictions, and requirements to stay at home were added.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""INTERPRETATION"">Individual NPIs, including school closure, workplace closure, public events ban, ban on gatherings of more than ten people, requirements to stay at home, and internal movement limits, are associated with reduced transmission of SARS-CoV-2, but the effect of introducing and lifting these NPIs is delayed by 1-3 weeks, with this delay being longer when lifting NPIs. These findings provide additional evidence that can inform policy-maker decisions on the timing of introducing and lifting different NPIs, although R should be interpreted in the context of its known limitations.</AbstractText>

It was deduced from empirical observations that peptides consisting of complementary (sense and antisense) amino acids interact with higher probability and affinity than the randomly selected ones. This phenomenon is closely related to the structure of the standard genetic code table, and at the same time, is unrelated to the direction of its codon sequence translation. The concept of <i>complementary peptide interaction</i> is discussed, and its possible applications to diagnostic tests and bioengineering research are summarized. Problems and difficulties that may arise using APT are discussed, and possible solutions are proposed. The methodology was tested on the example of SARS-CoV-2. It is shown that the CABS-dock server accurately predicts the binding of antisense peptides to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain without requiring predefinition of the binding site. It is concluded that the benefits of APT outweigh the costs of random peptide screening and could lead to considerable savings in time and resources, especially if combined with other computational and immunochemical methods.</AbstractText></Abstract>",0,2021-09-14 00:00:00

Specification curve analysis (SCA) was used to examine associations of risk perception of COVID-19 with emotion and self-rated mental health. This robust method considers all reasonable model specifications to avoid subjective analytical decisions while accounting for multiple testing.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">All 162 multilevel linear regressions in the SCA indicated that higher risk perception of COVID-19 was significantly associated with less positive or more negative emotions (median standardised β=-0.171, median SE=0.004, P&lt;0.001). Specifically, regressions involving economic risk perception and negative emotions revealed stronger associations. Moreover, risk perception at baseline survey was inversely associated with subsequent mental health (standardised β=-0.214, SE=0.029, P&lt;0.001). We further used SCA to explore whether this inverse association was mediated by emotional distress. Among the 54 multilevel linear regressions of mental health on risk perception and emotion, 42 models showed a strong mediation effect, where no significant direct effect of risk perception was found after controlling for emotion (P&gt;0.05).</AbstractText>

Investigating the determinants of adherence to social distancing can inform public health strategies to improve the behaviour. However, there is a lack of data in various populations. This study investigates the degree to which South Africans complied with social distancing during the country's COVID-19 lockdown and identifies the determinants associated with being in close contact with large numbers of people. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> Data was collected from a South African national online survey on a data free platform, supplemented with telephone interviews. The survey was conducted from 8 to 29 April 2020. The primary outcome was the number of people that participants came into close contact with (within a 2-metre distance) the last time they were outside their home during the COVID-19 lockdown. Multivariate multinomial regression investigated the socio-demographic, psychosocial and household environmental determinants associated with being in contact with 1-10, 11-50 and more than 50 people. <b>Results:</b> Of the 17,563 adult participants, 20.3% reported having not left home, 50.6% were in close physical distance with 1-10 people, 21.1% with 11-50 people, and 8.0% with &gt;50 people. Larger household size and incorrect knowledge about the importance of social distancing were associated with being in contact with &gt;50 people. Male gender, younger age and being in the White and Coloured population groups were significantly associated with being in contact with 1-10 people but not with larger numbers of people. Employment, at least secondary school education, lack of self-efficacy in being able to protect oneself from infection, and moderate or high risk perception of becoming infected, were all associated with increased odds of close contact with 1-10, 11-50, and &gt;50 people relative to remaining at home. <b>Conclusion:</b> The findings identify subgroups of individuals that are less likely to comply with social distancing regulations. Public health communication, interventions and policy can be tailored to address these determinants of social distancing.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2021 Sewpaul, Mabaso, Dukhi, Naidoo, Vondo, Davids, Mokhele and Reddy.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>",0,2021-06-14 00:00:00

                <AbstractText>Cancer patients suffer changes in energy balance (EB), the combination of energy intake (nutrition) and energy expenditure (physical activity (PA)), which may influence cancer-related morbidity, mortality, and quality of life. Significant gaps remain in our understanding of the frequency and magnitude of these EB changes. Herein, we report on the feasibility and acceptability of a longitudinal repository of EB outcomes in children, adolescents and young adults (AYA) with cancer along the cancer continuum to fill these gaps. This EB repository includes PA, nutrition, and physical function (PF) parameters. PA data were gathered through activity trackers. Nutritional data were gathered through food diaries and micronutrient labs. PF was assessed with validated objective and patient-reported measures. Feasibility was achieved with &gt;50% enrollment of eligible patients (<i>n</i> = 80, Mage = 18.1 ± 7.5); 26 were children with cancer and 54 were AYAs with cancer. An 88.75% retention rate indicated acceptability. Despite COVID-19 disruptions, &gt;50% of participants provided completed data for PA and micronutrient labs as of April 2020. Food diaries and PF data collection experienced disruptions. Methodological adaptations are in progress to minimize future disruptions. Overall, our findings demonstrate that prospective EB assessments are feasible and acceptable among children and AYAs with cancer.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>This paper proposes a three-phase Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead (3P-SIRD) model to calculate an optimal lockdown period for some specific geographical regions that will be favorable to break not only the transmission chain but also will help country's economy to recover and support infrastructure in a fight against COVID-19. Proposed model is novel since it additionally includes parameters <i>i.e.</i> silent carriers, sociability of newly infected person and unregistered died coronavirus infected people along with the infection rate, suspected rate and death rate. These parameters contribute a lot to figure out the more clear model, along with essential parameters. The model takes the testing rate of suspected people into consideration and this rate varies with respect to phase of the epidemic growth. Proposed 3P-SIRD model is divided into three-phases based on the awareness and sustainability of disease. Time is divided into different periods as rate of infection and recovery fluctuates region to region. The model is tested on China data and is efficient enough to propose a model very close to their actual figures of infected people, recovered people, died and active cases. The model predicts the optimal lockdown period as 73 days for China which is very close to their actual lockdown period (77 days). Further, the model is implemented to predict the optimal lockdown period of India and Italy.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"">COVID-19 has impacted on healthcare provision. Anecdotally, investigations for children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have been restricted, resulting in diagnosis with no histological confirmation and potential secondary morbidity. In this study, we detail practice across the UK to assess impact on services and document the impact of the pandemic.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">For the month of April 2020, 20 tertiary paediatric IBD centres were invited to contribute data detailing: (1) diagnosis/management of suspected new patients with IBD; (2) facilities available; (3) ongoing management of IBD; and (4) direct impact of COVID-19 on patients with IBD.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">All centres contributed. Two centres retained routine endoscopy, with three unable to perform even urgent IBD endoscopy. 122 patients were diagnosed with IBD, and 53.3% (n=65) were presumed diagnoses and had not undergone endoscopy with histological confirmation. The most common induction was exclusive enteral nutrition (44.6%). No patients with a presumed rather than confirmed diagnosis were started on anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) therapy.Most IBD follow-up appointments were able to occur using phone/webcam or face to face. No biologics/immunomodulators were stopped. All centres were able to continue IBD surgery if required, with 14 procedures occurring across seven centres.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>On March 11, 2020, the WHO director general declared COVID-19 a pandemic. This pandemic evolves in successive phases, i.e., phase 1 (the start phase), phase 2 (""the storm""), and phase 3 (the recession). To date, oncology and surgery groups have only given instructions for addressing phases 1 and 2. To prevent excess cancer mortality, health care systems (HCS) need to be restructured. Our aim is to detail the specificities of each epidemic phase and discuss several methods of organization to optimize cancer patient flow during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly during phase 3. Hospitals must be reorganized in order to create a cancer hub that is free of infection, allowing for the safe treatment of patients. Hospital structures are different, but all allow for the creation of virus-free areas. Screening programs are critical and need to be applied to all people entering the virus-free zone, including health care workers. Some reorganization proposals are internal to a hospital, while others require interhospital collaboration. The heterogeneity and complexity of HCS will make interhospital management difficult. The ministry of health has an important role in managing the cancer crisis. Cancer management should be declared a priority. Oncological and surgical societies must coordinate their efforts to facilitate this prioritization. The anticipation of oncological management during phase 3 of the pandemic is necessary because it requires a complete readjustment of HCS. This adaptation should allow for the continuation of cancer care to prevent excess cancer mortality, as the virus will still be present for a currently undetermined period of time.</AbstractText>

Many workers have been forced to shift to work-from-home, adjust their commute patterns, and/or adopt new behaviors. Particularly important in the context of mitigating transportation-related emissions is the shift to work-from-home. This paper focuses on two major shifts along different stages of the pandemic. First, it investigates switching to work-from-home during the pandemic, followed by assessing the likelihood of continuing to work-from-home as opposed to returning to the workplace. This second assessment, being conditioned on workers having experienced work-from-home as the result of the pandemic, allows important insights into the factors affecting work-from-home probabilities. Using a survey collected in July and August of 2020, it is found that nearly 50 percent of the respondents who did not work-from-home before but started to work-from-home during the COVID-19 pandemic, indicated the willingness to continue work-from-home. A total of 1,275 observations collected using the survey questionnaire, that was administered through a U.S. nationwide panel (Prime Panels), were used in the model estimation. The methodological approach used to study work-from-home probabilities in this paper captures the complexities of human behavior by considering the effects of unobserved heterogeneity in a multivariate context, which allows for new insights into the effect of explanatory variables on the likelihood of working from home. Random parameters logit model estimations (with heterogeneity in the means and variances of random parameters) revealed additional insights into factors affecting work-from-home probabilities. It was found that gender, age, income, the presence of children, education, residential location, or job sectors including marketing, information technologies, business, or administration/administrative support all played significant roles in explaining these behavioral shifts and post-pandemic preferences.</AbstractText></Abstract>",0,2021-09-29 00:00:00

Based on the trend of the loss of protective IgG antibodies after the first wave and the seropositivity of 75% in the district in July 2021, simple forecasting and proportional estimates of the seropositivity in the next eight months and the estimated maximum number of the cases was done. We also considered the seropositivity without vaccination in July 2021 (63%). Additionally, the trend of the weekly RT-PCR and rapid antigen testing for SARS-CoV-2 may also preemptively predict an imminent wave. Based on the East Singhbhum population and the vaccination coverage with at least one dose till July 2021 (Covishield or Covaxin), it is estimated that a 4-5% monthly vaccination coverage rate of new individuals will not allow the seropositivity to fall below 50% and hold at bay a major wave. Vaccination coverage of 3% or less would allow a continuous drop in acquired immunity in the district and can potentially cause a rise in cases, making the community susceptible to a future surge of infections. A 3-5% vaccination rate of new individuals is unlikely to see a drop in the community seropositivity below 50% and the number of new cases of COVID-19 infections going above 478 to 712 per month at least till March 2022. The assumptions are based on presuming that there will be no new mutant of SARS-CoV-2 that escapes the immunity provided by previous infection or vaccination over the next eight months. However, currently, there is no evidence to speculate on any new variant of concern causing a major wave globally. The B.1.617.2 (delta) variant was first identified in October 2020 and there was a lag of six months to the second surge of COVID-19 infections in East Singhbhum, primarily caused by this variant. Additionally, 3% and above, with a rising weekly trend of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positivity for SARS-CoV-2 can provide at least four to eight weeks advance warning before the peak of the wave if an imminent future wave is impending.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2021, Nag et al.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>",0,2021-09-25 00:00:00

                <AbstractText>Introduction - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is considered to be highly contagious and restriction of transmission requires the utilization of protective equipment like surgical masks from both healthcare workers and public. The aim of this review is to investigate the role of surgical masks during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods - A literature research was conducted via PubMed to detect articles featuring the potential protective role of surgical masks when they were worn by healthcare workers or by the general public. Results - Among 114 articles, only 31 met the inclusion criteria. Thirteen additional articles provided useful information according to the aim of this review. Existing literature supports the positive effect of surgical masks on COVID-19 con-lamination. Debate on the efficacy of surgical masks compared with other forms of facial protective devices exists. There seems to be a tendency to favor the use of particulate-filtering facepiece respirators in healthcare professionals who face higher risk of infection. However, surgical masks primarily and cloth masks secondarily seem to be adequate means of protection for the general public and for healthcare workers during procedures where respiratory droplets are not generated. Rational use of surgical masks is imperative; however, reuse after decontamination is not ideal. Conclusions - For optimum protection from COVID-19, the use of surgical masks should be combined with other infection control measures like hand hygiene and social distancing, since the level of their effectiveness is still being investigated. Shortage of surgical masks should be prevented; therefore, rational use plays a crucial role in this direction.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label=""PURPOSE OF REVIEW"">SARS-CoV-2 is the novel human coronavirus responsible for the COVID19 pandemic. Accurate detection of infection with SARS-CoV-2 is an essential component of efforts to treat individual patients and to contain spread of the virus in the community. The purpose of this review is to describe current diagnostic modalities for SARS-CoV-2 and outline their use. Special considerations for pediatric age groups are included.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""RECENT FINDINGS"">RNA PCR from the upper respiratory tract remains the gold standard for detection of infection with SARS-CoV-2. Antigen testing is being widely deployed as a faster and more convenient alternative to PCR, but is less sensitive and should only be used for diagnosis early after symptom onset. Serologic assays can document prior infection and are helpful in diagnosing multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Serologic testing should not be used to diagnose acute or active infection. Immune assays are likely to provide a useful measure of protection against COVID19 in the future as knowledge of protective responses improves.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""SUMMARY"">A variety of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics have recently been developed and deployed. Clinicians should understand the appropriate use and interpretation of RNA PCR, antigen testing and immune assays for SARS-CoV-2 in order to diagnose and treat patients in this evolving pandemic.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText><b>Introduction</b>: The COVID-19 pandemic remains aglobal challenge. While there are mRNA agents on the horizon as apotential prevention, adefinitive drug therapy is an unmet medical need. The hyperinflammatory response, known as the 'cytokine storm', is chiefly responsible for complications and deaths. The binding of spike-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 to TLR4 receptors has been documented in several studies and has been found to play arole in hyperinflammation; hence, there is an interest in TLR4 as apotential drug target.<b>Areas covered</b>: This review discusses the neurological and respiratory complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection and progresses to examine the role of the 'cytokine storm' and the involvement of TLR4 receptors in these complications. The possibility of using TLR4 modulators to curb the complications are considered and finally, ashort perspective on future potential drug treatments is offered. Various databases were searched including Pub-Med, Google Scholar, and Medline. The search mainly included research articles, meta-analysis, retrospective studies, reports, and systematic reviews.<b>Expert opinion</b>: TLR4 modulators are being investigated in clinical trials for COVID-19. Challenges in terms of structural diversity of the agents, their natural origin, and efficacy demand extensive research.</AbstractText>

Besides, it has been reported that antihistamine drugs could prevent viruses from entering cells. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether azelastine have antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and the possible mechanism. Here, we discovered antihistamine azelastine has an affinity to ACE2 by cell membrane chromatography (CMC); Then we determined the equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of azelastine-ACE2 as (2.58 ± 0.48) × 10<sup>-7</sup> M by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The results of molecular docking showed that azelastine could form an obvious hydrogen bond with Lys353.

Genomic analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is phylogenetically related to severe acute respiratory syndrome-like (SARS-like) bat viruses, therefore bats could be the possible primary reservoir. The intermediate source of origin and transfer to humans is not known, however, the rapid human to human transfer has been confirmed widely. There is no clinically approved antiviral drug or vaccine available to be used against COVID-19. However, few broad-spectrum antiviral drugs have been evaluated against COVID-19 in clinical trials, resulted in clinical recovery.

                <AbstractText>The recent outbreak of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2 or 2019-nCoV) and its worldwide spread is posing one of the major threats to human health and the world economy. It has been suggested that SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARSCoV based on the comparison of the genome sequence. Despite the genomic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARSCoV, the spike glycoprotein and receptor binding domain in SARS-CoV-2 shows the considerable difference compared to SARS-CoV, due to the presence of several point mutations. The analysis of receptor binding domain (RBD) from recently published 3D structures of spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 (Yan, R., et al. (2020); Wrapp, D., et al. (2020); Walls, A. C., et al. (2020)) highlights the contribution of a few key point mutations in RBD of spike glycoprotein and molecular basis of its efficient binding with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label=""AIMS"">Chronic heart failure (HF) is a major comorbidity accounting for an increased severity and mortality related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To reduce the risk of COVID-19 in HF patients, telemedicine has been encouraged.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""METHODS AND RESULTS"">During the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedical management with mainly over-the-phone appointments became a major strategy of follow-up of our HF clinic patients. Previously, the large majority of patients have been seen in the hospital with direct patient-provider contact. We compared both strategies of follow-up, in pre-pandemic (PPP) and pandemic (PP) periods, regarding total mortality and hospitalizations/emergency department (ED) visits due to HF exacerbation. We prospectively studied a cohort of 196 patients. The mean follow-up time in PPP was 1.4 years. In this period, 20 patients died. In PP (follow-up of 71 days), there was one additional death. Total mortality in the first year of follow-up was 12.0%, matching the mortality predicted by the Meta-Analysis Global Group in Chronic Heart Failure score. Considering hospitalizations/ED visits due to decompensated HF, there was no statistically significant difference between PPP and PP. Only one patient was diagnosed with COVID-19.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">In the light of an increase in telemedical management of this cohort of HF patients, we were able to maintain a low rate of admissions due to HF decompensation, without an increment in mortality. Regarding these results, we encourage the incremental use of telemedicine in HF patients in the context of this or future pandemics and also in situations in which physical consultation might not be possible due to logistic issues.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label=""Results"">The study included 8 patients with severe degenerative aortic valve stenosis, 6 with chronic postinfarction heart failure, and 3 healthy control participants. Their mean age was 75.7 (range, 54-89) years, and 6 were women. Mean CHIP-driver gene variant allele frequency was 4.2% (range, 2.5%-6.9%) for DNMT3A and 14.3% (range, 2.6%-37.4%) for TET2. Participants with DNMT3A or TET2 CHIP-driver sequence variations displayed increased expression of interleukin 1β (no CHIP-driver sequence variations, 1.6217 normalized Unique Molecular Identifiers [nUMI]; DNMT3A, 5.3956 nUMI; P &lt; .001; TET2, 10.8216 nUMI; P &lt; .001), the interleukin 6 receptor (no CHIP-driver sequence variations, 0.5386 nUMI; DNMT3A, 0.9162 nUMI; P &lt; .001;TET2, 0.5738 nUMI; P &lt; .001), as well as the NLRP3 inflammasome complex (no CHIP-driver sequence variations, 0.4797 nUMI; DNMT3A, 0.9961 nUMI; P &lt; .001; TET2, 1.2189 nUMI; P &lt; .001), plus upregulation of CD163 (no CHIP-driver sequence variations, 0.5239 nUMI; DNMT3A, 1.4722 nUMI; P &lt; .001; TET2, 1.0684 nUMI; P &lt; .001), a cellular receptor capable of mediating infection, macrophage activation syndrome, and other genes involved in cytokine response syndrome. Gene ontology term analyses of regulated genes revealed that the most significantly upregulated genes encode for leukocyte-activation and interleukin-signaling pathways in monocytes of individuals with DNMT3A (myeloid leukocyte activation: log[Q value], -50.1986; log P value, -54.5177; regulation of cytokine production: log[Q value], -21.0264; log P value, -24.1993; signaling by interleukins: log[Q value], -18.0710: log P value, -21.1597) or TET2 CHIP-driver sequence variations (immune response: log[Q value], -36.3673; log P value, -40.6864; regulation of cytokine production: log[Q value], -13.1733; log P value, -16.3463; signaling by interleukins: log[Q value], -12.6547: log P value, -15.7977).</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Despite the high number of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) cases from India, there are few reports from India describing the clinical epidemiology of COVID-19. This study aimed to describe the clinical/epidemiological characteristics and outcomes of asymptomatic vs. symptomatic COVID-19 patients. This was a retrospective chart review of all admitted patients with COVID-19 above 18 years with a history of travel within one month of the admission. The patients were categorized into asymptomatic and symptomatic. The symptomatic patients were further classified into mild, moderate and severe. The demographic profile, risk factors, clinical features, laboratory parameters, treatment details and outcome of all patients were recorded. The clinical and laboratory parameters were compared between symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients. Of the 127 recruited patients, 75 were asymptomatic. Of the 52 symptomatic patients, 41 patients were classified as a mild illness. The mean age of the patients was 44.5 ± 15 years. A total of 73 patients had one or more risk factors. The male patients were more commonly found to be symptomatic compared to female patients. Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase were significantly elevated in symptomatic patients. A total of five individuals required supplemental oxygen therapy, and one of them required mechanical ventilation. All the patients had favourable outcomes. Asymptomatic and mild illness form a significant proportion of positive patients and have excellent outcomes without therapeutic interventions.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Senior individuals are more susceptible to the irreversible outcomes of endothelial barrier dysfunction, the hallmark of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronovirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) - inflicted ARDS delivers the devastating outcomes of the COVID-19 worldwide. Endothelial hyperpermeability has been associated with both the progression and establishment of the COVID-19 - related respiratory failure. In the present study we investigated the in vitro effects of Metformin in the permeability of bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells. Our preliminary results suggest that moderate doses (0.1, 0.5, 1.0 mM) of this anti-diabetic agent enhance the vascular barrier integrity, since it produces an increase in the transendothelial resistance of endothelial monolayers. Thus, we speculate that Metformin may deliver a new therapeutic possibility in ARDS, alone or in combination with other barrier enhancers.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>The SARS-CoV-2 causes severe pulmonary infectious disease with an exponential spread-ability. In the present research, we have tried to look into the molecular cause of disease, dealing with the development and spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Therefore, different approaches have investigated against disease development and infection in this research; First, We identified hsa-miR-1307-3p out of 1872 pooled microRNAs, as the best miRNA, with the highest affinity to SARS-CoV-2 genome and its related cell signaling pathways. Second, the findings presented that this miRNA had a considerable role in PI3K/Act, endocytosis, and type 2 diabetes, moreover, it may play a critical role in the prevention of GRP78 production and the virus entering, proliferation and development. Third, nearly 1033 medicinal herbal compounds were collected and docked with ACE2, TMPRSS2, GRP78, and AT1R receptors, which were the most noticeable receptors in causing the COVID-19. Among them, there were three common compounds including berbamine, hypericin, and hesperidin, which were more effective and appropriate to prevent the COVID-19 infection. Also, it was revealed some of these chemical compounds which had a greater affinity for AT1R receptor inhibitors can be suitable therapeutic targets for inhibiting AT1R and preventing the adverse side effects of this receptor. According to the result, clinical assessment of these three herbal compounds and hsa-miR-1307-3p may have significant outcomes for the prevention, control, and treatment of COVID-19 infection.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Coronavirus is normally transmitted from animal to person, but nowadays it is transmitted from person to person by changing its form. Covid-19 appeared as a very dangerous virus and unfortunately caused a worldwide pandemic disease. Radiology doctors use X-ray or CT images for the diagnosis of Covid-19. It has become crucial to help diagnose such images using image processing methods. Therefore, a novel intelligent computer vision method to automatically detect the Covid-19 virus was proposed. The proposed automatic Covid-19 detection method consists of preprocessing, feature extraction, and feature selection stages. Image resizing and grayscale conversion are used in the preprocessing phase. The proposed feature generation method is called Residual Exemplar Local Binary Pattern (ResExLBP). In the feature selection phase, a novel iterative ReliefF (IRF) based feature selection is used. Decision tree (DT), linear discriminant (LD), support vector machine (SVM), k nearest neighborhood (kNN), and subspace discriminant (SD) methods are chosen as classifiers in the classification phase. Leave one out cross-validation (LOOCV), 10-fold cross-validation, and holdout validation are used for training and testing. In this work, SVM classifier achieved 100.0% classification accuracy by using 10-fold cross-validation. This result clearly has shown that the perfect classification rate by using X-ray image for Covid-19 detection. The proposed ResExLBP and IRF based method is also cognitive, lightweight, and highly accurate.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>The COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly, with over 37 million cases and more than 1 million deaths reported by mid-October, 2020, with true numbers likely to be much higher in the many countries with low testing rates. Many communities are highly vulnerable to the devastating effects of COVID-19 because of overcrowding in domestic settings, high burden of comorbidities, and scarce access to health care. Access to testing is crucial to globally recommended control strategies, but many communities do not have adequate access to timely laboratory services. Geographic dispersion of small populations across islands and other rural and remote settings presents a key barrier to testing access. In this Personal View, we describe a model for the implementation of decentralised COVID-19 point-of-care testing in remote locations by use of the GeneXpert platform, which has been successfully scaled up in remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities across Australia. Implementation of the decentralised point-of-care testing model should be considered for communities in need, especially those that are undertested and socially vulnerable. The decentralised testing model should be part of the core global response towards suppressing COVID-19.</AbstractText>

A binary logistic regression model was performed to differentiate the characteristics of headache related to COVID-19.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""FINDINGS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">A total of 3458 participants (2341 females;67.7%, 1495 healthcare workers;43.2%) with a mean age of 43.21 ± 11.2 years contributed to the survey. Among them, 262 participants had COVID-19 diagnosis and 126 (48.1%) were male. The rate of males in the group without COVID-19 was 31% (991 out of 3196 participants) showing significant gender difference between groups (p &lt; 0.000). COVID-19 related headaches were more closely associated with anosmia/ageusia and gastrointestinal complaints (p &lt; 0.000 and p &lt; 0.000), and showed different characteristics like pulsating, pressing, and even stabbing quality. Logistic regression analyses showed that bilateral headache, duration over 72 h, analgesic resistance and having male gender were significant variables to differentiate COVID-19 positive patients from those without COVID-19 (p = 0.04 for long duration and p &lt; 0.000 for others). A worsening of previous primary headaches due to the pandemic-related problems was not reported in the majority of patients.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""INTERPRETATION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Bilateral, long-lasting headaches, resistance to analgesics and having male gender were more frequent in people with COVID-19 in conjunction with anosmia/ageusia and gastrointestinal complaints. These features may be helpful for diagnosing the headache related to COVID-19 during the pandemic.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label=""INTRODUCTION"">Passive data from smartphone sensors may be useful for health-care research. Our aim was to use the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic as a positive control to assess the ability to quantify behavioral changes in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) from smartphone data.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">Eight participants used the Beiwe smartphone application, which passively measured their location during the COVID-19 outbreak. We used an interrupted time series to quantify the effect of the US state of emergency declaration on daily home time and daily distance traveled.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">After the state of emergency declaration, median daily home time increased from 19.4 (interquartile range [IQR], 15.4-22.0) hours to 23.7 (IQR, 22.2-24.0) hours and median distance traveled decreased from 42 (IQR, 13-83) km to 3.7 (IQR, 1.5-10.3) km. The participant with the lowest functional ability changed behavior earlier. This participant stayed at home more and traveled less than the participant with highest functional ability, both before and after the state of emergency.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""DISCUSSION"">We provide evidence that smartphone-based digital phenotyping can quantify the behavior of people with ALS. Although participants spent large amounts of time at home at baseline, the COVID-19 state of emergency declaration reduced their mobility further. Given participants' high level of daily home time, it is possible that their exposure to COVID-19 could be less than that of the general population.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>The mucosal immune system is the largest component of the entire immune system, having evolved to provide protection at the main sites of infectious threat: the mucosae. As SARS-CoV-2 initially infects the upper respiratory tract, its first interactions with the immune system must occur predominantly at the respiratory mucosal surfaces, during both inductive and effector phases of the response. However, almost all studies of the immune response in COVID-19 have focused exclusively on serum antibodies and systemic cell-mediated immunity including innate responses. This article proposes that there is a significant role for mucosal immunity and for secretory as well as circulating IgA antibodies in COVID-19, and that it is important to elucidate this in order to comprehend especially the asymptomatic and mild states of the infection, which appear to account for the majority of cases. Moreover, it is possible that mucosal immunity can be exploited for beneficial diagnostic, therapeutic, or prophylactic purposes.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>One of the criteria to a strong principle in natural sciences is simplicity. The conventional view holds that the world is provided with natural laws that must be simple. This common-sense approach is a modern rewording of the medieval philosophical/theological concept of the Multiple arising from (and generated by) the One. Humans need to pursue unifying frameworks, classificatory criteria and theories of everything. Still, the fact that our cognitive abilities tend towards simplification and groupings does not necessarily entail that this is the way the world works. Here we ask: what if singularity does not pave the way to multiplicity? How will we be sure if the Ockham's razor holds in real life? We will show in the sequel that the propensity to reduce to simplicity the relationships among the events leads to misleading interpretations of scientific issues. We are not going to take a full sceptic turn: we will engage in active outreach, suggesting examples from biology and physics to demonstrate how a novel methodological antiunitary approach might help to improve our scientific attitude towards world affairs. We will provide examples from aggregation of SARS-Cov-2 particles, unclassified extinct creatures, pathological brain stiffness. Further, we will describe how antiunitary strategies, plagiarising medieval concepts from William od Ockham and Gregory of Rimini, help to explain novel relational approaches to quantum mechanics and the epistemological role of our mind in building the real world.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText><b>Context:</b> The human development territories have been severely constrained under the Covid-19 pandemic. A common dynamics has been observed, but its propagation has not been homogeneous over each continent. We aimed at characterizing the non-viral parameters that were most associated with death rate. <b>Methods:</b> We tested major indices from five domains (demography, public health, economy, politics, environment) and their potential associations with Covid-19 mortality during the first 8 months of 2020, through a Principal Component Analysis and a correlation matrix with a Pearson correlation test. Data of all countries, or states in federal countries, showing at least 10 fatality cases, were retrieved from official public sites. For countries that have not yet finished the first epidemic phase, a prospective model has been computed to provide options of death rates evolution. <b>Results:</b> Higher Covid death rates are observed in the [25/65°] latitude and in the [-35/-125°] longitude ranges. The national criteria most associated with death rate are life expectancy and its slowdown, public health context (metabolic and non-communicable diseases (NCD) burden vs. infectious diseases prevalence), economy (growth national product, financial support), and environment (temperature, ultra-violet index). Stringency of the measures settled to fight pandemia, including lockdown, did not appear to be linked with death rate. <b>Conclusion:</b> Countries that already experienced a stagnation or regression of life expectancy, with high income and NCD rates, had the highest price to pay. This burden was not alleviated by more stringent public decisions. Inherent factors have predetermined the Covid-19 mortality: understanding them may improve prevention strategies by increasing population resilience through better physical fitness and immunity.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization announced the Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) as a global pandemic, which originated in China. At the host level, COVID-19, caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), affects the respiratory system, with the clinical symptoms ranging from mild to severe or critical illness that often requires hospitalization and oxygen support. There is no specific therapy for COVID-19, as is the case for any common viral disease except drugs to reduce the viral load and alleviate the inflammatory symptoms. Tuberculosis (TB), an infectious disease caused by <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (Mtb), also primarily affects the lungs and has clinical signs similar to pulmonary SARS-CoV-2 infection. Active TB is a leading killer among infectious diseases and adds to the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide. In immunocompetent individuals, primary Mtb infection can also lead to a non-progressive, asymptomatic latency. However, latent Mtb infection (LTBI) can reactivate symptomatic TB disease upon host immune-suppressing conditions. Importantly, the diagnosis and treatment of TB are hampered and admixed with COVID-19 control measures. The US-Center for Disease Control (US-CDC) recommends using antiviral drugs, Remdesivir or corticosteroid (CST), such as dexamethasone either alone or in-combination with specific recommendations for COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization or oxygen support. However, CSTs can cause immunosuppression, besides their anti-inflammatory properties. The altered host immunity during COVID-19, combined with CST therapy, poses a significant risk for new secondary infections and/or reactivation of existing quiescent infections, such as LTBI. This review highlights CST therapy recommendations for COVID-19, various types and mechanisms of action of CSTs, the deadly combination of two respiratory infectious diseases COVID-19 and TB. It also discusses the importance of screening for LTBI to prevent TB reactivation during corticosteroid therapy for COVID-19.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Of the 368 patients, 18 patients were excluded as they didn't receive anti-tumor treatment, and 350 patients were included in the final analysis. 229 cases were treated with oral targeted drugs, and 121 cases were treated with chemotherapy or immunotherapy. 41.3% of patients treated with intravenous chemotherapy or immunotherapy experienced treatment discontinuation, and the proportion of treatment discontinuation in chemotherapy or immunotherapy was higher than those treated with oral targeted drugs (21.0%). Whether oral targeted drugs or intravenous chemotherapy or immunotherapy, more than 60% of patients experienced delays in imaging examinations. Nearly one third of patients developed new symptoms or exacerbation of existing symptoms. 26.6%-28.9% of patients have changed their treatment plans through online consultation. During novel coronavirus pneumonia, 40%-75% of lung cancer patients have mental health problems, and more than 95% of patients support government's prevention and control measures.</AbstractText>

Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection is one of the biggest concerns in terms of not only the antibody reaction to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) upon reinfection with the virus but also the reaction to COVID-19 vaccines. In this study, we evaluated ADE of infection by using COVID-19 convalescent-phase plasma and BHK cells expressing human Fcγ receptors (FcγRs). We found that FcγRIIA and FcγRIIIA mediated modest ADE of infection against SARS-CoV-2. Although ADE of infection was observed in monocyte-derived macrophages infected with SARS-CoV-2, including its variants, proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine expression was not upregulated in macrophages. SARS-CoV-2 infection thus produces antibodies that elicit ADE of infection, but these antibodies do not contribute to excess cytokine production by macrophages. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Viruses infect cells mainly via specific receptors at the cell surface. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection is an alternative mechanism of infection for viruses to infect immune cells that is mediated by antibodies and IgG receptors (FcγRs). Because ADE of infection contributes to the pathogenesis of some viruses, such as dengue virus and feline coronavirus, it is important to evaluate the precise mechanism of ADE and its contribution to the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. Here, using convalescent-phase plasma from COVID-19 patients, we found that two types of FcγRs, FcγRIIA and FcγRIIIA, mediate ADE of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although ADE of infection was observed for SARS-CoV-2 and its recent variants, proinflammatory cytokine production in monocyte-derived macrophages was not upregulated. These observations suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection produces antibodies that elicit ADE of infection, but these antibodies may not be involved in aberrant cytokine release by macrophages during SARS-CoV-2 infection.</AbstractText></Abstract>",0,2021-09-28 00:00:00

Modeling such diseases can be extremely valuable in predicting their effects. Although classic statistical modeling may provide adequate models, it may also fail to understand the data's intricacy. An automatic COVID-19 detection system based on computed tomography (CT) scan or X-ray images is effective, but a robust system design is challenging. In this study, we propose an intelligent healthcare system that integrates IoT-cloud technologies. This architecture uses smart connectivity sensors and deep learning (DL) for intelligent decision-making from the perspective of the smart city. The intelligent system tracks the status of patients in real time and delivers reliable, timely, and high-quality healthcare facilities at a low cost. COVID-19 detection experiments are performed using DL to test the viability of the proposed system. We use a sensor for recording, transferring, and tracking healthcare data. CT scan images from patients are sent to the cloud by IoT sensors, where the cognitive module is stored. The system decides the patient status by examining the images of the CT scan. The DL cognitive module makes the real-time decision on the possible course of action. When information is conveyed to a cognitive module, we use a state-of-the-art classification algorithm based on DL, i.e., ResNet50, to detect and classify whether the patients are normal or infected by COVID-19. We validate the proposed system's robustness and effectiveness using two benchmark publicly available datasets (Covid-Chestxray dataset and Chex-Pert dataset). At first, a dataset of 6000 images is prepared from the above two datasets. The proposed system was trained on the collection of images from 80% of the datasets and tested with 20% of the data. Cross-validation is performed using a tenfold cross-validation technique for performance evaluation. The results indicate that the proposed system gives an accuracy of 98.6%, a sensitivity of 97.3%, a specificity of 98.2%, and an F1-score of 97.87%. Results clearly show that the accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and F1-score of our proposed method are high. The comparison shows that the proposed system performs better than the existing state-of-the-art systems. The proposed system will be helpful in medical diagnosis research and healthcare systems. It will also support the medical experts for COVID-19 screening and lead to a precious second opinion.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2021.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>",0,2021-09-16 00:00:00

                <AbstractText>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a global pandemic in the past four months and causes respiratory disease in humans of almost all ages. Although several drugs have been announced to be partially effective treatments for this disease, no approved vaccine is available. Here, we described the construction of a recombinant Lactobacillus plantarum strain expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The results showed that the spike gene with optimized codons could be efficiently expressed on the surface of recombinant L. plantarum and exhibited high antigenicity. The highest protein yield was obtained under the following conditions: cells were induced with 50 ng/mL SppIP at 37 °C for 6-10 h. The recombinant spike (S) protein was stable under normal conditions and at 50 °C, pH = 1.5, or a high salt concentration. Recombinant L. plantarum may provide a promising food-grade oral vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 infection.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Physical inactivity is one major modifiable risk factor for dementia (especially Alzheimer's disease). Due to contact restrictions and isolation measures in response to the current COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic, physical inactivity levels have increased by up to 30%, which will likely have adverse consequences for primary and secondary dementia prevention. Therefore, new interdisciplinary prevention approaches (eg, outdoor exercise; app-based exercise with online partners) are urgently needed that account for the suspected long-term lifestyle changes that the current-and upcoming-pandemics are likely to entail (increased use of home office, social isolation, avoidance of fitness centers and club sports, and so on).</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"">COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is a new, rapidly emerging zoonotic infectious disease, that was reported to the World Health Organization for the first time on 31 December 2019. Currently, no effective pharmacological interventions or vaccines are available to treat or prevent COVID-19, therefore nonpharmacological public health measures are more in focus.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">Because of the current COVID-19 pandemic, WHO commissioned a rapid review. To save time, the method of systematic reviews was slightly and with caution modified. This publication is a summary of the most important aspects of the rapid review, translated into German by members of the WHO Collaborating Centre at the Danube University Krems (Austria).</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">Overall, 29 studies were included. Ten modeling studies focused on COVID-19, 4 observational studies and 15 modeling studies focused on SARS and MERS. The modeling studies consistently reported a benefit of the simulated quarantine measures. For example, the models estimated that quarantine of people exposed to confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19 prevented between 44 and 81% of the cases that would otherwise have happened and 31 to 63% of the deaths, when compared to no such measures. In regard to costs, the earlier the quarantine measures are implemented, the greater the cost savings will be.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Our confidence in the evidence is very limited. This is mainly because the COVID-19 studies based their models on the limited data that have been available in the early weeks of the pandemic and made different assumptions about the virus. The studies of SARS and MERS are not completely generalizable to COVID-19. Despite only having limited evidence, all the studies found quarantine to be important for controlling the spread of severe coronavirus diseases. Looking to the coming months, in order to maintain the best possible balance of measures, decision makers must continue to constantly monitor the outbreak situation and the impact of the measures they implement.</AbstractText>

What can we do as HFE experts, now that the scenario has completely changed? We contend that: (a) we can favour and support the heuristics that are applied to manage the load of psycho-cognitive stress. (b) We can observe, collect strategies and develop analytic schemes, thereby creating a memory of the organization for improvement in the future. (c) And we can support in educating and engaging the public.

The gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19 is viral nucleic acid detection with real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, the sensitivity of RT-PCR in the diagnosis of early-stage COVID-19 is less. Recent research works have shown that computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest are effective for the early diagnosis of COVID-19. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are proven successful for diagnosing various lung diseases from CT scans. CNNs are composed of multiple layers which represent a hierarchy of features at each level. CNNs require a big number of labeled instances for training from scratch. In medical imaging tasks like the detection of COVID-19 where there is a difficulty in acquiring a large number of labeled CT scans, pre-trained CNNs trained on a huge number of natural images can be employed for extracting features. Feature representation of each CNN varies and an ensemble of features generated from various pre-trained CNNs can increase the diagnosis capability significantly. In this paper, features extracted from an ensemble of 5 different CNNs (MobilenetV2, Shufflenet, Xception, Darknet53 and EfficientnetB0) in combination with kernel support vector machine is used for the diagnosis of COVID-19 from CT scans. The method was tested using a public dataset and it attained an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.963, accuracy of 0.916, kappa score of 0.8305, F-score of 0.91, sensitivity of 0.917 and positive predictive value of 0.904 in the prediction of COVID-19.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2021.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>",0,2021-08-24 00:00:00

                <AbstractText>The outbreak of the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has notably affected the medical system worldwide and influenced the health-seeking behavior of people while depleting medical resources, causing a delay in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) management. In this single-center, retrospective cohort study, we compared the clinical pictures of nontransfer patients who presented to the emergency department directly and received primary percutaneous cardiovascular intervention (PPCI) from February 1 to April 30, 2020 (group 2, <i>N</i> = 28), with patients who received PPCI from February 1 to April 30, 2016-2019 (group 1, <i>N</i> = 130). A total of 158 patients with STEMI who received PPCI were included in the study. A decrease in the percentage of patients with door-to-balloon time &lt;90 minutes was found in group 2 (64.3% vs. 81.5%, <i>p</i> = 0.044). The adjusted odds ratio was calculated using logistic regression, according to potential confounding factors such as age, sex, off-hours, and Killip class. An adjusted odds ratio of 2.45 (95% confidence interval, 1.1-6.0, <i>p</i> = 0.048) was reported for group 2. A decrease in the percentage of patients meeting the criteria of door-to-balloon time &lt;90 minutes was demonstrated, and differences were revealed in the clinical pictures of patients with STEMI after the pandemic. While systemic factors contributed the most, improvements and adjustments in the protocols for managing patients with STEMI for better outcomes in the COVID-19 era have yet to be studied.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Social isolation and loneliness are ongoing threats to health made worse by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. During the pandemic, half the globe's population have been placed under strict physical distancing orders and many long-term care facilities serving older adults went into lockdown mode, restricting access to all visitors, including family members. Before the pandemic emerged, a 2020 National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine report warned of the underappreciated adverse effects of social isolation and loneliness on health, especially among older populations. Social isolation and loneliness predict all-cause mortality at rates that rival clinical risk factors, such as obesity and smoking; they are associated with greater incidence of psychological, cognitive, and physical morbidities. This paper sets forth a proposal to design robots to function as companions and friends for socially isolated and lonely older people during pandemic emergencies and in aging societies more generally. ""The proposal"" section presents and defends the proposal. The ""Replies to objections"" section answers objections based on coercive design, replacement of humans with robots, privacy incursions, and counterfeit companionship. The ""Conclusion"" section submits that sociable robots offer a promising avenue for addressing social isolation and loneliness during pandemics and hold promise for aging societies more broadly.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Since the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), loss of smell has increasingly been reported as a frequent clinical sign. Understanding the underlying mechanism and the prognostic value of this symptom will help better manage patients. SARS-CoV-2, as SARS-CoV-1, may likely spread to the central nervous system (CNS) via the olfactory nerve, a known gateway for respiratory neurotropic viruses. We hypothesise that sudden loss of smell due to COVID-19 is the consequence of a protective host defence mechanism involving apoptosis of olfactory receptor neurons. Sacrificing smelling over neuroprotection is a logical strategy, even more so as olfaction is the only sense with the ability to regenerate in adults. Induced apoptosis of olfactory neurons has been shown in mice, successfully preventing neuroinvasion. On the other hand, adult olfactory neurogenesis has been shown to be regulated in part by the immune system, allowing to restore olfactory function. Understanding anosmia as part of a defence mechanism would support the concept of sudden anosmia as being a positive prognostic factor in the short term. Also, it may orient research to investigate the risk of future neurodegenerative disease linked to persisting coronavirus in neurons.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>This work presents simulation results for different mitigation and confinement scenarios for the propagation of COVID-19 in the metropolitan area of Madrid. These scenarios were implemented and tested using EpiGraph, an epidemic simulator which has been extended to simulate COVID-19 propagation. EpiGraph implements a social interaction model, which realistically captures a large number of characteristics of individuals and groups, as well as their individual interconnections, which are extracted from connection patterns in social networks. Besides the epidemiological and social interaction components, it also models people's short and long-distance movements as part of a transportation model. These features, together with the capacity to simulate scenarios with millions of individuals and apply different contention and mitigation measures, gives EpiGraph the potential to reproduce the COVID-19 evolution and study medium-term effects of the virus when applying mitigation methods. EpiGraph, obtains closely aligned infected and death curves related to the first wave in the Madrid metropolitan area, achieving similar seroprevalence values. We also show that selective lockdown for people over 60 would reduce the number of deaths. In addition, evaluate the effect of the use of face masks after the first wave, which shows that the percentage of people that comply with mask use is a crucial factor for mitigating the infection's spread.</AbstractText>

Key policies include a coordinated emergency action plan permitting duty of care within the context of a pandemic, and care pathway revision. This requires the rapid implementation of strategies and policies for a nursing response to the new care scenarios: personnel redistribution, nursing workflow revision, acquisition of new skills and knowledge, effective communication strategies, infection control policies, risk assessment and surveillance programmes, and continuous supplying of personal protective equipment. Finally, within a pandemic context, clear nursing policies reinforcing the role of nurses as patient and caregiver educators are needed to promote infection prevention behaviour in the general population.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>The novel corona virus disease (Covid-19) outbreak has caused great uncertainty in all spheres of human life. The experience has been incredibly humbling given that no country or section of society, regardless of its wealth or status, has been spared. The pandemic is not only a health crisis, but is also having serious damaging effects on societies, economies and vulnerable groups. Timely response is necessary in order to alleviate human suffering and to prevent irreversible destruction of livelihoods. This paper provides preliminary data on the socio-economic impacts of Covid-19 in the coastal city of Mombasa, Kenya, at the time of government-imposed curfews and cessation of movement. We conducted online surveys for two weeks during the restrictions period. The data was collected using online questionnaires directed at the city residents. The data highlights the mobile gender gap resulting from gender inequalities, residents' reliance on the government for Covid-19 information but lack of trust for government interventions, inadequate provisions of essential services, and the residents' lack of preparedness to tackle similar challenges in the future.</AbstractText>

The findings will provide temporal insights on the onset, severity, and recovery of sensory changes with COVID-19 infection, the consistency of symptoms, and the frequency of full smell recovery among patients with COVID-19. This self-administered and cost-effective approach has many advantages over self-report questionnaire-based methods and provides a more objective measure of smell and taste changes associated with COVID-19 infection; this will encourage otherwise asymptomatic individuals who are potential spreaders of the virus to self-isolate and seek formal medical diagnosis if they experience a sudden change in sensory acuity. This broadened case finding can potentially help control the COVID-19 pandemic and reduce the emergence of clusters of infections.</AbstractText>

During the early months of the pandemic, when little was known about the virus, the acute hypoxemic respiratory failure it caused did not appear to fit conveniently or consistently into our classification of ARDS. This not only re-ignited a half-century's long simmering debate over taxonomy, but also fueled similar debates over how PEEP and lung-protective ventilation should be titrated, as well as the appropriate role of noninvasive ventilation in ARDS. COVID-19 ignited other debates on emerging concepts such as ARDS phenotypes and patient self-inflicted lung injury from vigorous spontaneous breathing. Over a year later, these early perplexities have receded into the background without having been reviewed or resolved. With a full year of evidence having been published, this narrative review systematically analyzes whether COVID-19-associated respiratory failure is essentially ARDS, with perhaps a somewhat different course of presentation. This includes a review of the severity of hypoxemia and derangements in pulmonary mechanics, PEEP requirements, recruitment potential, ability to achieve lung-protective ventilation goals, duration of mechanical ventilation, associated mortality, and response to noninvasive ventilation. This paper also reviews the concepts of ARDS phenotypes and patient self-inflicted lung injury as these are crucial to understanding the contentious debate over the nature and management of COVID-19.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2021 by Daedalus Enterprises.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>",0,2021-07-29 00:00:00

                <AbstractText>Adolescence is a complex developmental phase, made more complex by obesity and the social isolation imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The literature related to the impact of social isolation on obesity self-management in adolescents is scant and inconsistent. This paper describes the phenomenon from the perspectives of a sample of adolescents with obesity enrolled in an inpatients' multidisciplinary rehabilitation program for weight-loss and their caregivers, and its impact on different life domains. Individual semi-structured ad hoc interviews were conducted with 10 adolescent-caregiver dyads, and narratives were qualitatively investigated using an interpretative phenomenology approach to data. Twenty participants took part in the study. The major themes that emerged from this study fall into five basic categories: (1) COVID-19 as an opportunity to reconsider what makes a good life; (2) Persistence in life; (3) Empowering relationship; (4) Daily routine in quarantine; (5) Lives on hold. Understandings drawn from this study may assist health care professionals in providing holistic support, and guidance to adolescents with weight-related issues and their caregivers who experience social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label=""Background"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">As evidenced by several studies, mental distress increased substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this period, citizens were asked to exercise a high degree of self-control with regard to personal and social health behavior. At the same time, we witnessed an increase of prosocial acts and shared creative expressions, which are known to serve as sources of meaning. Meaning in life and self-control are acknowledged psychological resources. Especially in times of crisis, meaning in life has been shown to be a crucial factor for resilience and coping. However, threatening and stressful situations can also jeopardize existential security and trigger crises of meaning. The present study aimed to document levels of acute COVID-19 stress and general mental distress in Germany and Austria during the lockdown and in the weeks thereafter. In order to identify potential risk factors related to demographics and living conditions, their associations with COVID-19 stress were analyzed exploratively. The primary objective of the study, however, was to investigate the buffering effect of two psychological resources-meaningfulness and self-control-with regard to the relation between acute COVID-19 stress and general mental distress. Finally, a potential aggravation of mental distress due to the occurrence of crises of meaning was examined.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""Method"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">A cross-sectional survey was conducted online during lockdown (survey group 1) and the subsequent weeks characterized by eased restrictions (survey group 2). A total of N = 1,538 German-speaking participants completed a questionnaire battery including a novel measure of acute COVID-19 stress, meaningfulness and crisis of meaning (SoMe), self-control (SCS-KD), and a screening of general mental distress, measured by core symptoms of depression and anxiety (PHQ-4). In a first step, associations between living conditions, demographics, and COVID-19 stress were explored. Second, a moderation and a mediation model were tested. Meaningfulness, a measure of presence of meaning in life, as well as self-control were proposed to serve as buffers in a time of crisis, thus moderating the relation between acute COVID-19 stress and general mental distress (double moderation). Crisis of meaning, operationalizing an experienced lack of meaning in life, was proposed to mediate the relationship between acute COVID-19 stress and general mental distress, with an assumed moderation of the association between COVID-19 stress and crisis of meaning by survey group (lockdown versus eased restrictions after lockdown), and a hypothesized moderation of the link between crisis of meaning and general mental distress by self-control (dual moderated mediation).</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""Results"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">COVID-19 stress was slightly right-skewed. Scores were higher during lockdown than in the weeks thereafter. The rate of clinically significant general mental distress was high, exceeding prevalence rates from both the general population and clinical samples of the time before the pandemic. In the weeks following the lockdown (group 2), general mental distress and crisis of meaning were significantly higher than during lockdown (group 1), whereas meaningfulness and self-control were significantly lower. Demographically, age had the strongest association with COVID-19 stress, with older participants perceiving less acute stress (r = -.21). People who were partnered or married suffered less from COVID-19 stress (η2 = .01). Living alone (η2 = .006), living in a room versus a flat or house (η2 = .008), and being unemployed due to the pandemic (η2 = .008) were related to higher experience of COVID-19 stress. COVID-19 stress and general mental distress were strongly related (r = .53). Both meaningfulness and self-control were negatively associated with general mental distress (r = -.40 and -.36, respectively). They also moderated the relationship between COVID-19 stress and general mental distress: When meaningfulness was high, high COVID-19 stress was related to substantially lower PHQ-4 scores than when meaningfulness was low. The same held for self-control: High scores of self-control were associated with lower PHQ-4 scores especially when COVID-19 stress was high. Crisis of meaning mediated the relationship between COVID-19 stress and PHQ-4. There was a higher likelihood of crises of meaning occurring when COVID-19 stress was high; crisis of meaning, in turn, was associated with general mental distress. Survey group moderated the first path of this mediation, i.e., the relationship between COVID-19 stress and crisis of meaning: High scores of COVID-19 stress were associated more strongly with crisis of meaning in the second survey group (after the lockdown). Self-control moderated the second path, i.e., the relationship between crisis of meaning and PHQ-4: When a crisis of meaning was present, self-control could buffer its effect on general mental distress.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""Conclusions"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">Also in the present study among German-speaking participants, general mental distress was high. Scores were higher after than during the lockdown, indicating an ongoing destabilization for a significant part of the population. People who saw a meaning in their lives and who were capable of self-control reported substantially less mental distress. Meaningfulness and self-control also served as buffers between COVID-19 stress and general mental distress: When COVID-19 stress was high, the presence of meaningfulness and self-control accounted for lower general mental distress. Moreover, people who suffered strongly from COVID-19 stress were more likely to develop a crisis of meaning which, in turn, was associated with higher general mental distress. This suggests that ongoing anxiety and depression might (also) be based on existential struggles. Again here, self-control buffered the impact of crisis of meaning on general mental health. We conclude from these findings that public health policies can support citizens in coping with large-scale crises by enabling experiences of meaningfulness, e.g., through transparent and reliable modes of communicating goals and necessary intermediate steps. Moreover, health professionals are well advised to invite individuals to confront existential questions and struggles, and to encourage them to exercise self-control. The latter can be boosted by keeping higher-order goals salient-which again is inherently linked to an understanding of their meaning.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>A wide range of neurological complications of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is increasingly recognised. Although the majority of these remain ischaemic and haemorrhagic events, various disorders are being reported. In particular, several cases of diffuse acute leukoencephalopathy have been observed in critically ill patients with COVID-19 disease. We report the case of a 59-year-old man with multiple comorbidities and severe COVID-19 pneumonia who developed a diffuse leukoencephalopathy with microhaemorrhages and extensive associated white matter necrosis. Although this is the first documented case of extensive COVID-19-associated white matter necrosis, we highlight the relatively constant features of this injury similar to previously reported cases, including symmetrical involvement of the supratentorial white matter, sparing of the peripheral subcortical regions except in the precentral gyri, frequently associated microhaemorrhages, relative sparing of the deep gray matter structures and infratentorial structures, and lack of enhancement.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"">There is extensive concern about older people's care in institutions, especially recently in the past years. One of the reasons is linked to the cases of elder abuse, not only shown by academic and scientific sources, but also by social and mass media and their impact on public perception of the institutional setting. What is more, current COVID-19 pandemic consequences on older people have provoked alarm and worry especially about what is happening in institutions.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">The sample for this study consists of 286 staff working in nursing homes in Spain. This study aimed to assess the psychometric properties of the Professional Good Care Scale in Nursing Homes (GCS-NH).</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Results of parallel analyses and exploratory factor analyses (EFAs) showed a four-factor model for the 32-item scale: humanization (9 items), non-infantilization (10 items), respect (7 items) and empowerment (6 items). Then, psychometric properties were tested analysing internal consistency (reliability) and convergent, divergent and criterion validity. High internal consistency (reliability) and different validity evidence were obtained for the total scores of the GCS-NH and its subscales. GCS-NH scores were also capable of detecting risk of probable institutional elder abuse.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Results show that this scale is an appropriate, valid, and reliable multidimensional instrument to evaluate good care in older institutionalized people by staff. Good care is an outcome of a complex construct in which a wide range of factors converge (staff, older people, and environmental characteristics). The GCS-NH has potential to be used as a multidimensional tool to assess good care.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Standard blood laboratory parameters may have diagnostic potential, if polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) tests are not available on time. We evaluated standard blood laboratory parameters of 655 COVID-19 patients suspected to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, who underwent PCR testing in one of five hospitals in Vienna, Austria. We compared laboratory parameters, clinical characteristics, and outcomes between positive and negative PCR-tested patients and evaluated the ability of those parameters to distinguish between groups. Of the 590 patients (20-100 years, 276 females and 314 males), 208 were PCR-positive. Positive compared to negative PCR-tested patients had significantly lower levels of leukocytes, neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, monocytes, and thrombocytes; while significantly higher levels were detected with erythrocytes, hemoglobin, hematocrit, C-reactive-protein, ferritin, activated-partial-thromboplastin-time, alanine-aminotransferase, aspartate-aminotransferase, lipase, creatine-kinase, and lactate-dehydrogenase. From all blood parameters, eosinophils, ferritin, leukocytes, and erythrocytes showed the highest ability to distinguish between COVID-19 positive and negative patients (area-under-curve, AUC: 72.3-79.4%). The AUC of our model was 0.915 (95% confidence intervals, 0.876-0.955). Leukopenia, eosinopenia, elevated erythrocytes, and hemoglobin were among the strongest markers regarding accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, positive and negative likelihood ratio, and post-test probabilities. Our findings suggest that especially leukopenia, eosinopenia, and elevated hemoglobin are helpful to distinguish between COVID-19 positive and negative tested patients.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>It is now well known that the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) originated in the Wuhan province of Hubei, China in 2019. Having spread across different countries of the world, this highly contagious disease has posed many challenges for the healthcare workers to work without endangering themselves and their patients' wellbeing. Several things are yet not clear about the virus and the presence or absence of the virus in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is currently a debated topic. This article reports the perioperative management of two coronavirus disease-19 positive cases, one of whom was a pregnant patient. Their CSF samples, which were collected during the administration of spinal anesthesia, tested to be negative for viral reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. We wish to highlight from these cases, that during spinal anesthesia, CSF in mildly symptomatic COVID-19 cases probably does not pose a risk of transmission to the anesthesiologist. However, we suggest that due to the varied presentations of the virus, health care personnel, especially anesthesiologists have to be careful during the perioperative management of such cases.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses but can lead to more severe and diffusive diseases. A variety of signs and symptoms may be present, and infections can range in severity from the common cold and sore throat to more serious laryngeal or tracheal infections, bronchitis, and pneumonia. Among the seven coronaviruses that affect humans (SARS)-CoV, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, and the most recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represent potential life-threatening diseases worldwide. In adults, they may cause severe pneumonia that evolves in respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan failure with a high mortality rate. Children appear to be less susceptible to develop severe clinical disease and present usually with mild and aspecific symptoms similar to other respiratory infections typical of childhood. However, some children, such as infants, adolescents, or those with underlying diseases may be more at-risk categories and require greater caution from clinicians. Available data on pediatric coronavirus infections are rare and scattered in the literature. The purpose of this review is to provide to clinicians a complete and updated panel useful to recognize and characterize the broad spectrum of clinical manifestations of coronavirus infections in the pediatric age.</AbstractText>

We examined the reporting of mental health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh and initiatives undertaken to support mental health reported from the viewpoint of media. <b>Methods:</b> We reviewed articles published in 10 local newspapers, including seven Bangla and three English newspapers, during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. News topics were identified through discussions among the team members, with searches across online newspapers and portals. Data extrapolated from newspapers were documented in an Excel spreadsheet. A mixed-method approach was used following a framework analysis for analyzing data. Recurring issues and commonly emerging topics were generated from the data. Descriptive statistics were applied for analyzing quantitative data. <b>Results:</b> Between March 2020 and March 2021, we have identified 201 reports on mental health issues including 45 reports (22.4%) focused on stress due to the associated financial crisis, unemployment and loneliness, 50 reports (24.9%) of 80 apparent suicides linked to family issues, disharmony in conjugal relationships, harassment, sexual violence, emotional breakdown, financial crisis, and stigma due to COVID-19.There were 77 reports (38.3%) concerning domestic violence during the pandemic. Twenty-nine reports (14.4%) referenced actions taken by different organizations to address mental health issues in response to the pandemic in Bangladesh. <b>Conclusion:</b> News coverage has the scope to highlight important issues that can emerge as a consequence of the COVID-pandemic, such as mental health, in a low resource setting. Capacity building of the media on the way to report mental health issues during emergency situations could be a useful strategy for more credible reporting on mental health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic for raising awareness of the public and policymakers about the negative consequences on mental health of the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh.

                <AbstractText>The SARS-coronavirus 2 disease initially reported in December 2019 in China (COVID-19) represents a major challenge for intensive care medicine, due to the high number of ICU admission and the prolonged stay for many patients. Up to 5 % of COVID-19 infected patients develop severe acute hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation as supportive treatment. Apart from early antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatment, the management of COVID-19 patients is mainly applying protective mechanical ventilation, to support the injured lungs. However recently acquired data and clinical experience suggest that COVID-19-related ARDS presents some specificities that will be summarized in the present article.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>The impacts of COVID-19 have cut across both developed and developing countries alike. This has prompted different coping mechanisms for survival through these trying times. The reality of stigmatization in this period has negatively affected health-seeking behavior and public response to the outbreak. Challenges exist at both the community and the healthcare providing facilities. We present a review of best practices in coping with COVID-19. Our focus is on how to cope with the challenges and strategies to improve the response to the pandemic in Nigeria. It is required that safety measures be fully adopted and practiced by individuals and groups. Collaborative efforts are required by all stakeholders, government, healthcare workers, and private organizations to mitigate the negative effects of the pandemic, avoid stigmatization, and ease the return journey to normalcy.</AbstractText>

The reported number of fine-needle aspirations performed during the first semester of 2020 was significantly reduced. Poorly differentiated, medullary and anaplastic thyroid tumors are considered important indications for immediate surgical intervention. By contrast, most well-differentiated carcinomas present slow growth, and thus surgery can be deferred for a short period of time during which patients are under active surveillance. Thyroid surgeries have decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, prior to any intervention, negative COVID-19 status - with the use of a nasopharyngeal swab and reverse transcription PCR assay as the gold standard and chest CT scan as a complementary modality in some cases - must be confirmed to achieve a COVID-free pathway. Thorough preoperative assessment regarding both oncological and anatomical aspects should be performed to identify optimal timing for safe management.</AbstractText></Abstract>",0,2021-08-28 00:00:00

                <AbstractText>This study aimed to identify knowledge gaps regarding coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and develop an integrated educational program for healthcare workers. First, we designed and validated ten multiple-choice questions to identify knowledge gaps among healthcare workers. Within one month of the online test and curriculum offering, 5533 staff had completed the test, with a completion rate of 84.97%. There were 2618 healthcare workers who answered the pre-test 100% correctly. Those who did not answer the pre-test 100% correctly took multiple tests after learning through the online teaching materials. Eventually, 5214 staff passed the test (pre-test or post-test with 100% correct answers). The result showed that all staff had a low correct rate for personal protective equipment (PPE) use recommendations. The Infection Control Center conducted training sessions for hospital staff on how to wear protective clothing. Information on the selection and use of PPE for infection prevention was provided, and participants were allowed time to practice and familiarize themselves with the correct way to wear PPE. Moreover, the Department of Education and Research continued updating the online learning materials based on the most important updated peer-reviewed published articles. The attending teaching physicians helped to search, translate, and take notes on articles in the local language (traditional Chinese) for other colleagues to read easily. We expect to increase learning opportunities for healthcare workers, even during uncertain times such as the current coronavirus pandemic through (1) the hospital-wide course announcements, (2) the continuous placement of test questions and learning files on the digital learning platform, (3) the placement of journal highlights in cloud folders, and (4) the use of the digital learning platform on mobile phones accessible outside the hospital.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label=""INTRODUCTION"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"">Burnout syndrome is a major cause of decreased life quality, mental health, and productivity for physicians. It is strongly related to work overload and has been a scarcely studied topic in pediatric urology. During the COVID-19 pandemic, authorities' recommendations have led to big changes in pediatric urology practice worldwide. This study aimed to evaluate the level of burnout in Ibero-American pediatric urologists (IPUs) during this pandemic.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""MATERIAL AND METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">A cross-sectional study was conducted by applying an electronic survey during the COVID-19 pandemic peak to members of the two major associations of pediatric urology in Ibero-America (the Ibero-American Society of Pediatric Urology [SIUP] and the Brazilian School of Pediatric Urology [BSPU]) to evaluate demographic, pre-pandemic, and pandemic data. Burnout levels were assessed using the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI) questionnaire.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">A response rate of 40% was obtained (182 out of 455 IPU respondents). Participants were from 14 different countries in Ibero-America and 75.4% were male. Data showed that during the pandemic there was a significant decrease in weekly workload, that is: &gt; 40 h per week (h/w) (91.4%-44.6%, p &lt; 0.001); and &gt;6 h/w (94.9%-45.1%%, p &lt; 0.001) in operating room time (ORT). Personal (Pe-BO), work-related (W-BO), and patient-related (Pa-BO) burnout levels among IPUs were 26.3%, 22.3%, and 7.4%, respectively (Summary table). An important difference by gender was seen, with women suffering more from the syndrome (odds ratio of 2.67 [95% confidence interval, 1.285.58; p = 0.013] for Pe-BO and OR of 3.26 [95% CI, 1.52-7.01; p = 0.004] for W-BO).</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">A significant decrease in workload for IPU during the pandemic was observed, as well as a low level of burnout syndrome during this time.

                <AbstractText>Male hypogonadism, defined as an inadequate production of testosterone (T), is associated with a greater morbidity and mortality. Epidemiological studies identified T deficiency as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Also, low serum T levels impact on glucose homeostasis through a worse glucose uptake, utilization, and disposal, and the general negative impact on metabolism. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive and updated overview of the effects of T replacement therapy on metabolic and cardiovascular systems and prostate tissue in patients with hypogonadism, including molecular mechanisms through which T exerts its actions. Furthermore, recent findings on novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemiology have shown a greater mortality in male compared with female patients and a role of T in promoting the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) infection of the host cells has been demonstrated. Hence, the secondary aim of this review is to provide preliminary indications on the management in patients with COVID-19.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>The Covid-19 pandemic has placed unprecedented pressure on healthcare systems and workers around the world. Such pressures may impact on working conditions, psychological wellbeing and perception of safety. In spite of this, no study has assessed the relationship between safety attitudes and psychological outcomes. Moreover, only limited studies have examined the relationship between personal characteristics and psychological outcomes during Covid-19. From 22nd March 2020 to 18th June 2020, healthcare workers from the United Kingdom, Poland, and Singapore were invited to participate using a self-administered questionnaire comprising the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ), Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to evaluate safety culture, burnout and anxiety/depression. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine predictors of burnout, anxiety and depression. Of 3,537 healthcare workers who participated in the study, 2,364 (67%) screened positive for burnout, 701 (20%) for anxiety, and 389 (11%) for depression. Significant predictors of burnout included patient-facing roles: doctor (OR 2.10; 95% CI 1.49-2.95), nurse (OR 1.38; 95% CI 1.04-1.84), and 'other clinical' (OR 2.02; 95% CI 1.45-2.82); being redeployed (OR 1.27; 95% CI 1.02-1.58), bottom quartile SAQ score (OR 2.43; 95% CI 1.98-2.99), anxiety (OR 4.87; 95% CI 3.92-6.06) and depression (OR 4.06; 95% CI 3.04-5.42). Significant factors inversely correlated with burnout included being tested for SARS-CoV-2 (OR 0.64; 95% CI 0.51-0.82) and top quartile SAQ score (OR 0.30; 95% CI 0.22-0.40). Significant factors associated with anxiety and depression, included burnout, gender, safety attitudes and job role. Our findings demonstrate a significant burden of burnout, anxiety, and depression amongst healthcare workers. A strong association was seen between SARS-CoV-2 testing, safety attitudes, gender, job role, redeployment and psychological state. These findings highlight the importance of targeted support services for at risk groups and proactive SARS-CoV-2 testing of healthcare workers.</AbstractText>

In this paper, we develop the model of Dirk Brockmann and Dirk Helbing (2013) to theoretically explain the impact mechanism of prevention and control measures on the spread of the epidemic. Then, we divide the measures taken in China into two categories: mobility restrictions and other non-pharmacological interventions (O-NPI), and apply econometric approach to empirically test the effects of them. We find that although both of the two measures play a good role in controlling the development of the epidemic, the effect shows significant difference in different regions, and both the two measures had no significant effects in low-risk regions; Further, we prove that measures taken in a low-risk region is mainly against the imported cases, while a high-risk region has to defend against both imported cases and spread from within; The rapid and accurate transmission of information, a higher protection awareness of the public, and a stronger confidence of residents can promote the implementation of the measures.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>© 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

                <AbstractText><b>Introduction:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic has posed great challenges in inpatient rehabilitation services, not only to implement the preventative measures to avoid the spreading of the virus in a highly interactive, multidisciplinary setting but also to create a rehabilitation pathway for post-COVID-19 patients. The aim of this retrospective study was to describe the role of a digital and artificial intelligence platform (DAIP) in facilitating the implementation of changes in a rehabilitation service during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> We gathered qualitative and quantitative descriptors of the DAIP, including measures to assess its efficiency in scheduling therapy sessions, and staff satisfaction using two simple numeric rating scales and the System Usability Scale. We describe how the volume of activity and the quality of care of our rehabilitation service have changed when the DAIP was implemented by comparing the pre-COVID-19 and the pandemic periods for patients' [sex, age, co-morbidities, diagnosis, and Functional Independence Measure (FIM) gain] and service's (bed occupancy, patients' length of stay, and staff capacity) characteristics. <b>Results:</b> Bed occupancy and the impact of rehabilitation on patients' outcome remained stable between the two periods. The DAIP provided a qualitative support for goal setting from remote; 95% of the planned sessions were delivered; the time for scheduling and registering sessions dropped by 50%. Staff satisfaction was about 70% for the easiness and 60% for the usefulness, and the mean ""usability"" score was close to the cut off for sufficient usability (mean score 65 where 68 is the cut off). <b>Conclusion:</b> By applying the DAIP to rehabilitation treatment, it was shown that the management of rehabilitation can be efficiently performed even in the COVID-19 pandemic. Staff satisfaction reflected a good acceptance of the changes considering the turbulent changes and the stress burden occurring at the time of the pandemic.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText><b>Introduction</b>: There is an urgent need for safe and efficacious antiviral drugs to improve outcomes for COVID-19 patients. Understanding SARS-CoV-2 virology can elucidate potential drug targets for the inhibition of viral replication. <b>Areas covered</b>: This review offers insights into novel and repurposed drugs that may have activity against SARS-CoV-2. We searched the PubMed, Medline, Google Scholar, Web of Science and ClinicalTrials.gov for COVID-19 related therapy until 28 October 2020. using search words 'SARS-CoV-2', 'COVID-19', 'antiviral', and/or 'treatment'. <b>Expert opinion</b>: Remdesivir decreased symptom duration modestly but had no significant impact on survival. Antivirals alone may be insufficient for a specific subset of patients with severe disease because of cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Treatment may require a combination of antivirals and immunomodulators to inhibit viral replication and CRS, respectively. A safe and efficacious SARS-CoV-2 specific vaccine is critical for prevention and mortality reduction. Moreover, we cannot overstate the importance of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in testing of novel treatments. The pervasive stumbling block, however, is the low representation of minority groups. The benefit of remdesivir may not be generalizable to these populations because of significant underrepresentation in trials. Future endeavors should encompass the recruitment of patient populations that are reflective of the demographics significantly impacted by COVID-19.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>In late 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) initiated in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. The major clinical symptoms described for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) include respiratory distress and pneumonia in severe cases, and some patients may experience gastrointestinal impairments. In accordance, viral RNA or live infectious virus have been detected in feces of patients with COVID-19. Binding of SARS-CoV-2 to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a vital pathway for the virus entry into human cells, including those of the respiratory mucosa, esophageal epithelium as well as the absorptive enterocytes from ileum and colon. The interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 receptor may decrease the receptor expression and disrupt the function of B0AT1 transporter influencing the diarrhea observed in COVID-19 patients. In this context, a fecal-oral transmission route has been considered and points out a role for the digestive tract in disease transmission and severity. Here, in order to further understand the impact of COVID-19 in human physiology, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease severity are discussed in the context of gastrointestinal disturbances.</AbstractText>

Together with the acknowledged angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, glucose-regulated protein 78, transferrin receptor, AXL, kidney injury molecule-1, and neuropilin 1 are also identified as potential receptors to mediate SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, how to inhibit or delay the binding of SARS-CoV-2 with the abovementioned receptors is a key step for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. As the third gasotransmitter, hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) plays an important role in many physiological and pathophysiological processes. Recently, survivors were reported to have significantly higher H<sub>2</sub>S levels in COVID-19 patients, and mortality was significantly greater among patients with decreased H<sub>2</sub>S levels.

                <AbstractText>A 65-yr-old man visited a primary care hospital with a continued fever of 38°C for 3 days. As his fever did not improve until 8 days after, he was admitted into another acute care hospital, where his respiratory condition rapidly worsened. Therefore, the patient was transferred to our hospital. On the day of transfer (day 1), he was started on mechanical ventilation. COVID-19 was diagnosed using a polymerase chain reaction assay 6 days after admission (day 6). The rehabilitation therapy was begun on day 6. The initial rehabilitation programs focused on positioning and postural drainage. The patient was extubated on day 19, and he began standing and stepping on the same day. Gait exercises began on day 22, and endurance training was initiated on day 28. The patient was discharged from our hospital on day 34 as he met the physical function milestones. One month after discharge, the Medical Research Council sum score and Barthel Index had each improved; therefore, muscle strength and daily activities had returned to normal. It was assumed that mobilization should be performed as soon as possible after the end of sedation during the acute phase of severe COVID-19 infection in patients receiving mechanical ventilation.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Psychological science faces a call to action researching the implications of the corona virus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. Rapid reviews have reported that maintaining rigorous research standards is a priority for the field, such as ensuring reliable and valid measurement, when investigating people's experience of Covid-19 (O'Connor et al., 2020). However, no research to date has validated a measure mental health symptomology for an athlete population. The current research addresses this gap by examining the internal consistency, factor structure, invariance, and convergent validity of the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21; Lovibond and Lovibond, 1995) in two athlete samples. Participants completed the DASS-21 and sport-specific measures of mental health such as the Profile of Mood States - Depression subscale (POMS-D), Sport Anxiety Scale-2 (SAS-2), Athlete Burnout Questionnaire (ABQ), and Athlete Psychological Strain Questionnaire (APSQ). In sample one (<i>n</i> = 894), results of exploratory structural equation modeling indicated that a three-factor model provided good fit to the data, but a bifactor model provided better fit. Factor loadings indicated minimal misspecification and higher loadings on the general-factor. Invariance testing suggested equivalence across gender, athletic expertise, sport type, and injury status. Further, latent mean differences analyses indicated that females and injured athletes scored higher than male and non-injured athletes on all DASS-21 factors reporting higher mental health symptomology, those with more expertise scored higher on the general-factor and depression and those with less expertise scored higher on anxiety and stress, and no differences between team and individual athletes. In sample two (<i>n</i> = 589), the bifactor structure was replicated. Results largely supported the scales convergent validity with depression predicting POMS-D scores, whereas all three subscales predicted the SAS-2, ABQ, and APSQ scores. Internal consistency was acceptable in both samples. The current work provides initial support for use of the DASS-21 as an operationalisation of mental health symptomology in athletes. Theoretical and practical implications of these results are discussed.</AbstractText>

Countries all over the world have implemented some sort of lockdown to slow down its infection and mitigate it. Lockdown due to COVID-19 has drastic effects on social and economic fronts. However, this lockdown also has some positive effect on natural environment. Recent data released by NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) and ESA (European Space Agency) indicates that pollution in some of the epicenters of COVID-19 such as Wuhan, Italy, Spain and USA etc. has reduced up to 30%.

                <AbstractText>This study was to explore the performance of immune function and compositions of hospitalization cost for patients with COVID-19 as well as the application of a grey relational mathematical model (GRMM). A total of 100 COVID-19 patients diagnosed by nucleic acid test and chest CT examination in our hospital were collected in this study. They were divided into 2 groups: non-severe group (mild and moderate patients, n = 57 cases), and severe group (severe and critical patients, n = 43 cases) based on the <i>Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (Trial Version 7)</i> published by the World Health Organization (WHO). The general clinical data, blood routine indexes, cellular immune and humoral immune function test indexes, and the composition of hospitalization costs of the two groups of patients were collected and analyzed. The results showed that the average age, proportion of males, smoking history, and the number and proportion of patients in the non-severe group were smaller than those in the severe group (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05); the severe group had significantly more shortness of breath patients than the non-severe group (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Compared with the non-severe group, the number of white blood cells (WBC), the number and proportion of neutrophils, and the count of neutrophils/lymphocytes in the severe group increased obviously (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), and the number of lymphocytes and the proportion of monocytes decreased dramatically (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05); the number and proportion of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and CD19+ in the severe group were much lower in contrast to those in the non-severe group (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), while the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ was greatly higher in contrast to that of non-severe patients (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Compared with the non-severe group, the bed fee, laboratory test fee, diagnosis fee, and medicine fee of the severe group were increased observably (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). The changes in hospitalization cost of patients in the severe group was related to bed fees, laboratory fees, and expenses of proprietary Chinese medicines, while the hospitalization cost of patients in the severe group was related to bed fees, laboratory fees, and examination fees. The results revealed that elderly COVID-19 patients with basic diseases were prone to develop severe disease, immune cell depletion may be one of the reasons for the development of severe patients, and the medical insurance policy greatly reduced the hospitalization costs of COVID-19 patients.</AbstractText>

A mediation analysis was performed to identify the potential mediators in the relationship between cardiac injury and mortality. A total of 109 COVID-19 inpatients (female 36%, median age 71 years) were included. During in-hospital stay, 20 patients (18%) died and, compared with survivors, these patients were older, had more comorbidities defined by Charlson comorbidity index ≥ 3(65% vs 24%, p = 0.001), and higher levels of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (Hs-cTnI), both at first evaluation and peak levels. A dose-response curve between Hs-cTnI and in-hospital mortality risk up to 200 ng/L was detected. Hs-cTnI, chronic kidney disease, and chronic coronary artery disease mediated most of the risk of in-hospital death, with Hs-cTnI mediating 25% of such effect.

                <AbstractText>The emergence of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had rapidly spread since FEB/MAR 2020. Policy to prevent transmission of COVDI-19 resulted in multi-dimensional impact on social interaction. We aimed to develop a beneficial survey tool with favorable quality and availability, the Societal Influences Survey Questionnaire (SISQ), to evaluate social influences on people during this pandemic. The SISQ was developed with 15 items and 4-point Likert scales consisting of five factors. These include social distance, social anxiety, social desirability, social information, and social adaptation. Construct validity and reliability were performed to verify the SISQ. A total of 1912 Taiwanese were recruited. The results demonstrated that the SISQ has acceptable reliability, with Cronbach's alphas ranging between 0.57 and 0.76. The SISQ accounted for 58.86% and satisfied the requirement of Kaiser-Mayer-Olkinvalues (0.78) and significant Bartlett's Test of sphericity. Moreover, the confirmatory factor analysis fit indices also indicated the adequacy of the model. As for multiple comparison, females scored higher than males in factor of social distance. Unemployed participants and those without partners scored higher in several domains of factors. The survey method and survey instrument prove reliable and valuable, also providing different categories of assessment results regarding social influences and their impacts. Further studies are warranted to extend the applicability of SISQ.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>The world has been challenged by SARS CoV-2, a new virus causing pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, with common symptoms of COVID-19 in pediatric patients including both respiratory and GI symptoms. There is a lack of literature implicating COVID-19 in pancreatitis, yet viruses are generally understood to be a cause of pancreatitis in children. We present a case of a previously well 7-year-old girl, who presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of abdominal pain and anorexia. She was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis with an abnormal lipase, ultrasound, and computed tomography, and was found to be COVID-19 positive by polymerase chain reaction. Our case suggests that, in the current pandemic, consideration for SARS CoV-2 testing in children with gastrointestinal symptoms and pancreatitis may be considered. Additionally, this case highlights the need for appropriate personal protective equipment for providers, even when COVID is not initially on the differential.</AbstractText>

The inventory of Rh and K antigen-negative red cell units recommended for patients with hemoglobinopathies became alarmingly low and continues to be strained. Because patients with sickle cell disease requiring chronic red cell exchange (RCE) incur a large demand for red cell units, we hypothesized that implementation of 2 measures could reduce blood use. First, obtaining the pretransfusion hemoglobin S (HbS) results by procedure start time would facilitate calculation of exact red cell volume needed to achieve the desired post-RCE HbS. Second, as a short-term conservation method, we identified patients for whom increasing the targeted end procedure hematocrit up to 5 percentage points higher than the pretransfusion level (no higher than 36%) was not medically contraindicated. The goal was to enhance suppression of endogenous erythropoiesis and thereby reduce the red cell unit number needed to maintain the same target HbS%. These 2 measures resulted in an 18% reduction of red cell units transfused to 50 patients undergoing chronic RCE during the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite reduction of blood use, pretransfusion HbS% target goals were maintained and net iron accumulation was low. Both strategies can help alleviate a shortage of Rh and K antigen-negative red cells, and, more generally, transfusing red cell units based on precise red cell volume required can optimize patient care and judicious use of blood resources.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>© 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>",0,2021-07-14 00:00:00

                <AbstractText>SARS-CoV-2 enters cells using its Spike protein, which is also the main target of neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, assays to measure how antibodies and sera affect Spike-mediated viral infection are important for studying immunity. Because SARS-CoV-2 is a biosafety-level-3 virus, one way to simplify such assays is to pseudotype biosafety-level-2 viral particles with Spike. Such pseudotyping has now been described for single-cycle lentiviral, retroviral, and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) particles, but the reagents and protocols are not widely available. Here, we detailed how to effectively pseudotype lentiviral particles with SARS-CoV-2 Spike and infect 293T cells engineered to express the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, ACE2. We also made all the key experimental reagents available in the BEI Resources repository of ATCC and the NIH. Furthermore, we demonstrated how these pseudotyped lentiviral particles could be used to measure the neutralizing activity of human sera or plasma against SARS-CoV-2 in convenient luciferase-based assays, thereby providing a valuable complement to ELISA-based methods that measure antibody binding rather than neutralization.</AbstractText>

Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) driven smartphone apps can help alleviate such issues, allowing for in situ recordings. Implementing such an app is not trivial, necessitates strict regulatory and legal requirements, and requires short development cycles to appropriately react to abrupt changes in the pandemic. Based on an existing app framework, we developed Corona Health, an app that serves as a platform for deploying questionnaire-based studies in combination with recordings of mobile sensors. In this paper, we present the technical details of Corona Health and provide first insights into the collected data. Through collaborative efforts from experts from public health, medicine, psychology, and computer science, we released Corona Health publicly on Google Play and the Apple App Store (in July 2020) in eight languages and attracted 7290 installations so far. Currently, five studies related to physical and mental well-being are deployed and 17,241 questionnaires have been filled out. Corona Health proves to be a viable tool for conducting research related to the COVID-19 pandemic and can serve as a blueprint for future EMA-based studies. The data we collected will substantially improve our knowledge on mental and physical health states, traits and trajectories as well as its risk and protective factors over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic and its diverse prevention measures.</AbstractText></Abstract>",1,2021-07-29 00:00:00

                <AbstractText>The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted the rapid transition of in-person outpatient care to telemedicine, and clinical training to remote learning. The endocrinology fellows at the University of Michigan maintain their own continuity-of-care clinics and rotate in the Ann Arbor Veterans Affairs (VA) Healthcare System. For these clinics, we sought to preserve patient staffing with expert attending physicians and continue the clinical training experience in a remote setting. We have adapted the online conferencing platform, Zoom, to integrate learners into a virtual teaching clinic environment. By using the Zoom ""breakout room"" feature, fellows are able to match staffing attending physicians to different patient cases, according to attending physicians' areas of specialty. Similar to the traditional teaching clinic environment, our remote staffing strategy has ensured that fellows continue to provide excellent patient care and fulfill educational aims across our University and VA facilities. Outpatient clinics in other University of Michigan departments and other academic centers have inquired about or have begun utilizing our method. Even beyond COVID-19, our paradigm potentially provides a convenient virtual staffing platform to serve patient populations with geographic or transportation challenges. Following implementation, stakeholders can regularly evaluate the approach to continually improve both patient care and medical education.</AbstractText>

The ""bedside"" pulmonary ultrasound has an undeniable series of advantages in the patient at high infectious risk and can provide incremental data in the respiratory intensive care for the serial control of the individual patient as well as for the home delivery of the stabilized subjects. Pulmonary computed tomography shows high sensitivity but should not be routinely performed in all patients, because in the first 48 h it can be absolutely negative and in the late phase the imaging findings may not change the therapeutic approach. Echocardiography should be limited to patients with hemodynamic instability to assess ventricular function and pulmonary pressures.</AbstractText>

In order to reduce this percentage, physicians should establish clear and objective criteria to stratify COVID-19 patients at high risk of in-hospital death. Thus, the aim has been to test a large spectrum of variables ranging from clinical evaluation to laboratory biomarkers to identify which parameter would best predict all-cause in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. Design observational study. Results Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that each 5 years of increase in age corresponded to a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.28 (95% CI 1.00-1.65, P = .050); each increment of 803 ng/L of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) corresponded to a HR of 1.24 (95% CI 1.11-1.39, P &lt; .001); each increment of 58 ng/L of interleukin (IL)-6 corresponded to a HR of 1.23 (95% CI 1.09-1.40, P &lt; .001), and each increment of 250 U/L of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) corresponded to a HR of 1.23 (95% CI 1.10-1.37, P &lt; .001). According to the calculated cut-points for age (≥70 years), NT-proBNP (≥803 ng/L), IL-6 (≥58 ng/L) and LDH (≥371 U/L) when 2 out of these 4 were overcome, the HR was 2.96 (95% CI 1.97-4.45, P &lt; .001). Conclusion In COVID-19 patients, besides age, the evaluation of three biochemical parameters, available in few hours after hospital admission can predict in-hospital mortality regardless of other comorbidities.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>© 2021 The Authors.

Individual participant data were pooled from 2 retrospective cohorts: 1) The Moli-LOCK cohort consists of 1,501 adults, a portion of the larger Moli-sani Study (n=24,325; 2005-2010) who were administered a phone-based questionnaire to assess lifestyles and psychological factors during confinement; 2) the ALT RISCOVID-19 is a web-based survey of 1,491 individuals distributed throughout Italy who self-responded to the same questionnaire by using Google forms.UPF was defined according to NOVA classification based on degree of food processing. An UPF score was created by assigning 1 point to increased consumption, -1 to decreased and 0 point for unchanged intakes of 19 food items, with higher values indicating an increase in UPF during confinement.</AbstractText>

Telepsychiatry provides a platform bridging the gap through advanced technologies connecting mental health providers and patients who need their services, overcoming previous barriers of great distances, lack of transportation, and even time constraints. The most obvious benefit is increased accessibility to mental healthcare, especially in underserved and remote areas where there is no easy access for in-person care. It is important to note that benefits are not limited to patients, but also allow clinicians greater flexibility in scheduling and reduced practice overhead costs, both of which aid with physician burnout and burden. Telepsychiatry during COVID-19 provides its own unique advantages over in-person visits. The risk of exposure to healthcare workers and patients receiving care is reduced, allowing immunocompromised patients to receive much-needed psychiatric care. Without the need to meet in person, self-isolating psychiatrists can still provide care, decreasing strain on their co-workers. Although telepsychiatry is relatively new, it has already exhibited considerable success in its effectiveness at treating psychiatric conditions and widespread corollary benefits. Telepsychiatric consults may be carried out synchronously and asynchronously, each having benefits and setbacks. Different mobile application interventions have been explored, which are available for the purpose of both monitoring/assessing patients and/or providing treatment. The scope of conditions these applications address is broad, from anxiety disorders to schizophrenia to depression. As promising and beneficial telepsychiatry may seem, it is necessary to recognize that building the program can be challenging. It involves adapting to new methods in medicine. We highlighted barriers to general telepsychiatry, the most prominent being technological literacy of both physician and patient, and possible negative effects of eliminating the in-person patient-doctor interaction.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2021, Gude et al.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>",0,2021-09-21 00:00:00

This induces a need for the development of an analytical method for the quantification of camostat and its metabolites in plasma samples. Camostat is, however, very unstable in whole blood and plasma due to its two ester bonds. The molecule is readily hydrolysed by esterases to 4-(4-guanidinobenzoyloxy)phenylacetic acid (GBPA) and further to 4-guanidinobenzoic acid (GBA). For reliable quantification of camostat, a technique is required that can instantly inhibit esterases when blood samples are collected.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""DESIGN AND METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">An ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method (UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS) using stable isotopically labelled analogues as internal standards was developed and validated.

                <AbstractText>Coronavirus (COVID-19), an enveloped RNA virus, primarily affects human beings. It has been deemed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a pandemic. For this reason, COVID-19 has become one of the most lethal viruses which the modern world has ever witnessed although some established pharmaceutical companies allege that they have come up with a remedy for COVID-19. To that end, a set of carboxamides sulfonamide derivatives has been under study using 3D-QSAR approach. CoMFA and CoMSIA are one of the most cardinal techniques used in molecular modeling to mold a worthwhile 3D-QSAR model. The expected predictability has been achieved using the CoMFA model (Q<sup>2</sup> = 0.579; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.989; R<sup>2</sup>test = 0.791) and the CoMSIA model (Q<sup>2</sup> = 0.542; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.975; R<sup>2</sup>test = 0.964). In a similar vein, the contour maps extracted from both CoMFA and CoMSIA models provide much useful information to determine the structural requirements impacting the activity; subsequently, these contour maps pave the way for proposing 8 compounds with important predicted activities. The molecular surflex-docking simulation has been adopted to scrutinize the interactions existing between potentially and used antimalarial molecule on a large scale, called Chloroquine (CQ) and the proposed carboxamides sulfonamide analogs with COVID-19 main protease (PDB: 6LU7). The outcomes of the molecular docking point out that the new molecule <b>P1</b> has high stability in the active site of COVID-19 and an efficient binding affinity (total scoring) in relation with the Chloroquine. Last of all, the newly designed carboxamides sulfonamide molecules have been evaluated for their oral bioavailability and toxicity, the results point out that these scaffolds have cardinal ADMET properties and can be granted as reliable inhibitors against COVID-19.</AbstractText>

Instructors' acceptance of online teaching plays a crucial role, as the acceptance level can impact instructors' online teaching behaviors. This qualitative study examined medicine and public health instructors' perceptions of online teaching using the Technology Acceptance Model 2 (TAM2) model. Through semi-structured interviews with ten instructors in a Midwest university in the U.S., this study found that instructors had a high level of acceptance of online teaching. Instructors perceived the usefulness of online teaching in terms of learning objectives, assessment, instructional methods, and learning experience. Online teaching was perceived as useful overall, although challenges existed, such as online interaction, assessment, and hands-on practices. Regarding ease of use in online teaching, instructors perceived technology was easy to use; yet some pedagogical challenges existed, such as class engagement, the focus of learners' attention, and transforming hands-on lab or clinical sessions online. The blended model is recommended to use for teaching and learning in medical and public health education post the pandemic. Detailed implications for practice and research were discussed in the end.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2021.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>",0,2021-08-26 00:00:00

This relates particularly to the development of myocardial injury, acute coronary syndrome, myocarditis, arrhythmia, and heart failure. Prospective treatment approach is advised for these patients. To study the interplay between local changes (reduced contractility), global variables (peripheral resistances, heart rate) and the cardiac function, we considered a lumped parameters computational model of the cardiovascular system and a three-dimensional multiphysics model of cardiac electromechanics. Our mathematical model allows to simulate the systemic and pulmonary circulations, the four cardiac valves and the four heart chambers, through equations describing the underlying physical processes. By the assessment of conventionally relevant parameters of cardiac function obtained through our numerical simulations, we propose a computational model to effectively reveal the interactions between the cardiac and pulmonary functions in virtual subjects with normal and impaired cardiac function at baseline affected by mild or severe COVID-19.</AbstractText></Abstract>",0,2021-07-09 00:00:00

This article aims to explore the roles dentists have undertaken within the community setting and reflect on dentists' transferable skills, training and personal experiences during redeployment. Despite differences in healthcare delivery, both professions share skills surrounding professionalism, communication, raising concerns and consent. Community nurses have supported dentists through specific training and competencies so that the latter are equipped with skills to support roles including wound care, catheter care and medication administration. Dentists have been well-received by community nursing colleagues and patients during redeployment.

                <AbstractText>The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused an unprecedented burden on our healthcare systems and workers. Healthcare workers are at risk of contracting and spreading SARS-CoV-2 given their proximity to positive cases, often with a lack of personal protective equipment. The South African Department of Health requires that all employees be screened daily for symptoms and potential persons under investigation identified timeously. This report aims to assesses the efficacy of daily self-screening tools in detecting and managing potential staff cases of SARS-CoV-2. Our hospital, situated in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, developed a daily self-screening tool for all healthcare workers to complete, consisting of questions on symptoms and epidemiological risk factors. The screening tools were collected and assessed after four weeks of use. Fifty-four forms were assessed. Twenty-eight (51.9%) forms were not completed, whilst 12 (22.2%) indicated positive symptoms with no documentation that any further medical assessment, testing or isolation was done. We identified that the poor completion of forms was likely because of the lack of education of staff on the importance of the forms, poor oversight by management, staff forgetfulness or lack of awareness of the forms. Screening of staff is vital during this pandemic but requires constant oversight by line managers, staff motivation and adequate education. Ongoing development of efficient screening programmes is required.</AbstractText>

However, few studies have examined whether Saharan dust intrusions influence the incidence and severity of COVID-19 cases. To address this question, in this study we carried out generalized linear models with Poisson link between incidence rates and daily hospital admissions and average daily concentrations of PM<sub>10</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub> in nine Spanish regions for the period from February 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020. The models were adjusted by maximum daily temperature and average daily absolute humidity. Furthermore, we controlled for trend, seasonality, and the autoregressive nature of the series. The variable relating to Saharan dust intrusions was introduced using a dichotomous variable, NAF, averaged across daily lags in ranges of 0-7 days, 8-14 days, 14-21 days, and 22-28 days. The results obtained in this study suggest that chemical air pollutants, and especially NO<sub>2</sub>, are related to the incidence and severity of COVID-19 in Spain. Furthermore, Saharan dust intrusions have an additional effect beyond what is attributable to the variation in air pollution; they are related, in different lags, to both the incidence and hospital admissions rates for COVID-19. These results serve to support public health measures that minimize population exposure on days with particulate matter advection from the Sahara.</AbstractText></Abstract>",1,2021-05-20 00:00:00

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) facilitates ACE2-mediated virus entry. Moreover, the expression of <i>ACE2</i> in the testes of infertile men is higher than normal, which indicates that infertile men may be susceptible to be infected and SARS-CoV-2 may cause reproductive disorder through the pathway induced by <i>ACE2</i> and <i>TMPRSS2</i>. Little is known about the pathway regulation of <i>ACE2</i> and <i>TMPRSS2</i> expression in male reproductive disorder. Since the regulation of gene expression is mediated by microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) at the post-transcriptional level, the aim of this study was to analyze the dysregulated miRNA-lncRNA interactions of <i>ACE2</i> and <i>TMPRSS2</i> in male reproductive disorder. Using bioinformatics analysis, we speculate that the predicted miRNAs including <i>miR-125a-5p</i>, <i>miR-125b-5p</i>, <i>miR-574-5p</i>, and <i>miR-936</i> as regulators of <i>ACE2</i> and <i>miR-204-5p</i> as a modulator of <i>TMPRSS2</i> are associated with male infertility. The lncRNAs with a tissue-specific expression for testis including GRM7-AS3, ARHGAP26-AS1, BSN-AS1, KRBOX1-AS1, CACNA1C-IT3, AC012361.1, FGF14-IT1, AC012494.1, and GS1-24F4.2 were predicted. The identified miRNAs and lncRNAs are proposed as potential biomarkers to study the possible association between COVID-19 and male infertility. This study encourages further studies of miRNA-lncRNA interactions to explain the molecular mechanisms of male infertility in COVID-19 patients.</AbstractText></Abstract>",1,2021-07-08 00:00:00

                <AbstractText>The current COVID-19 pandemic has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and its causative agent, SARS-CoV-2, has infected millions, globally. The highly contagious nature of this respiratory virus has spurred massive global efforts to develop vaccines at record speeds. In addition to enhanced immunogen delivery, adjuvants may greatly impact protective efficacy of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. To investigate adjuvant suitability, we formulated protein subunit vaccines consisting of the recombinant S1 domain of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein alone or in combination with either CoVaccine HT™ or Alhydrogel. CoVaccine HT™ induced high titres of antigen-binding IgG after a single dose, facilitated affinity maturation and class switching to a greater extent than Alhydrogel and elicited potent cell-mediated immunity as well as virus neutralising antibody titres. Data presented here suggests that adjuvantation with CoVaccine HT™ can rapidly induce a comprehensive and protective immune response to SARS-CoV-2.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Accumulating evidence supports the high prevalence of co-infections among Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) patients, and their potential to worsen the clinical outcome of COVID-19. However, there are few data on Southern Hemisphere populations, and most studies to date have investigated a narrow spectrum of viruses using targeted qRT-PCR. Here we assessed respiratory viral co-infections among SARS-CoV-2 patients in Australia, through respiratory virome characterization. Nasopharyngeal swabs of 92 SARS-CoV-2-positive cases were sequenced using pan-viral hybrid-capture and the Twist Respiratory Virus Panel. In total, 8% of cases were co-infected, with rhinovirus (6%) or influenzavirus (2%). Twist capture also achieved near-complete sequencing (&gt; 90% coverage, &gt; tenfold depth) of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in 95% of specimens with Ct &lt; 30. Our results highlight the importance of assessing all pathogens in symptomatic patients, and the dual-functionality of Twist hybrid-capture, for SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequencing without amplicon generation and the simultaneous identification of viral co-infections with ease.</AbstractText>

However, the fast production of COVID-19 vaccines has caused concern among the general public regarding their safety and efficacy. In particular, patients with chronic illnesses, such as celiac disease (CD), may be more fearful. Information on vaccine hesitancy plays a pivotal role in the development of an efficient vaccination campaign. In our study, we aimed to evaluate COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among Italian CD patients. (2) Methods: an anonymous questionnaire was sent to CD patients followed at our tertiary referral center for CD in Milan, Italy. Patients were defined as willing, hesitant and refusing. We evaluated the reasons for hesitancy/refusal and the possible determinants, calculating crude and adjusted odds ratios [AdjORs] with 95% confidence intervals [CIs]. (3) Results: the questionnaire was sent to 346 patients with a response rate of 29.8%. Twenty-six (25.2%) of the 103 respondents were hesitant, with a total refusal rate of 4.8%. The main reason was fear of adverse events related to vaccination (68.2%). Among hesitant patients, 23% declared that their opinion was influenced by their CD. The determinants positively influencing willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19 were adherence to a GFD, perception of good knowledge about COVID-19 and its vaccines, and a positive attitude to previous vaccines (AdjOR 12.71, 95% CI 1.82-88.58, AdjOR 6.50, 95% CI 1.44-29.22, AdjOR 0.70, 95% CI 0.11-4.34, respectively). (4) Conclusions: CD patients should be vaccinated against COVID-19 and a specific campaign to address the determinants of hesitancy should be developed.</AbstractText></Abstract>",0,2021-06-15 00:00:00

                <AbstractText>Coronaviruses are a group of enveloped viruses with non-segmented, single-stranded, and positive-sense RNA genomes. In December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in Wuhan City, China. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus outbreak as a global pandemic in March 2020. Fever, dry cough and fatigue are found in the vast majority of all COVID-19 cases. Early diagnosis, treatment and future prevention are keys to COVID-19 management. Currently, the unmet need to develop cost-effective point-of-contact test kits and efficient laboratory techniques for confirmation of COVID-19 infection has powered a new frontier of diagnostic innovation. No proven effective therapies or vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 currently exist. The rapidly increasing research regarding COVID-19 virology provides a significant number of potential drug targets. Remdesivir may be the most promising therapy up till now. On May 1, 2020, Gilead Sciences, announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted emergency use authorization (EUA) for the investigational Remdesivir as a potential antiviral for COVID-19 treatment. On May 7, 2020, Gilead Sciences, announced that the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) has granted regulatory approval of Veklury® (Remdesivir) as a treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection, the virus that causes COVID-19 acute respiratory syndrome, under an exceptional approval pathway. Also, Corticosteroids are recommended for severe cases only to suppress the immune response and reduce symptoms, but not for mild and moderate patients where they are associated with a high-risk side effect. Based on the currently published evidence, we tried to highlight different diagnostic approaches, side effects and therapeutic agents that could help physicians in the frontlines.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Various non-pharmaceutical interventions were adopted by countries worldwide in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic with adverse socioeconomic side effects, which raises the question about their differential effectiveness. We estimate the average dynamic effect of each intervention on the incidence of COVID-19 and on people's whereabouts by developing a statistical model that accounts for the contemporaneous adoption of multiple interventions. Using daily data from 175 countries, we show that, even after controlling for other concurrent lockdown policies, cancelling public events, imposing restrictions on private gatherings and closing schools and workplaces had significant effects on reducing COVID-19 infections. Restrictions on internal movement and public transport had no effects because the aforementioned policies, imposed earlier on average, had already de facto reduced human mobility. International travel restrictions, although imposed early, had a short-lived effect failing to prevent the epidemic from turning into a pandemic because they were less stringent. We interpret the impact of each intervention on containing the pandemic using a conceptual framework which relies on their effects on human mobility behaviors in a manner consistent with time-use and epidemiological factors.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Convalescing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients mount robust T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2, suggesting an important role of T cells in viral clearance. To date, the phenotypes of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells remain poorly defined. Using 38-parameter CyTOF, we phenotyped longitudinal specimens of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from nine individuals who recovered from mild COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells were exclusively Th1 cells and predominantly Tcm cells with phenotypic features of robust helper function. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells were predominantly Temra cells in a state of less terminal differentiation than most Temra cells. Subsets of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells express CD127, can proliferate homeostatically, and can persist for over 2 months. Our results suggest that long-lived and robust T cell immunity is generated following natural SARS-CoV-2 infection and support an important role of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in host control of COVID-19.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label=""PURPOSE"" NlmCategory=""OBJECTIVE"">The aim of this work was to evaluate the dosimetric impact of high-resolution thorax CT during COVID-19 outbreak in the University Hospital of Parma. In two months we have performed a huge number of thorax CT scans collecting effective and equivalent organ doses and evaluating also the lifetime attributable risk (LAR) of lung and other major cancers.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""MATERIALS AND METHOD"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">From February 24th to April 28th, 3224 high-resolution thorax CT were acquired. For all patients we have examined the volumetric computed tomography dose index (CTDIvol), the dose length product (DLP), the size-specific dose estimate (SSDE) and effective dose (E<sub>103</sub>) using a dose tracking software (Radimetrics Bayer HealthCare). From the equivalent dose to organs for each patient, LAR for lung and major cancers were estimated following the method proposed in BEIR VII which considers age and sex differences.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">Study population included 3224 patients, 1843 male and 1381 female, with an average age of 67 years. The average CTDIvol, SSDE and DLP, and E<sub>103</sub> were 6.8 mGy, 8.7 mGy, 239 mGy·cm and 4.4 mSv respectively. The average LAR of all solid cancers was 2.1 cases per 10,000 patients, while the average LAR of leukemia was 0.2 cases per 10,000 patients. For both male and female the organ with a major cancer risk was lung.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Despite the impressive increment in thoracic CT examinations due to COVID-19 outbreak, the high resolution low dose protocol used in our hospital guaranteed low doses and very low risk estimation in terms of LAR.</AbstractText>

The objective of our study was to describe the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infections in different pediatric age groups during the first 2 months of the fall back-to-school period, in the context of increasing viral transmission in France.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">Weekly epidemiological data provided by Santé Publique France and the Ministry of National Education were analyzed according to the age groups defined by the different school levels. Weeks (W) 34-42 were considered for analysis.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">The PCR positivity rate and incidence rate increased in all age groups during the study period, in an age-dependent manner. At W42, with adults being considered as reference, the risk ratio for a positive PCR test was 0.46 [95% CI: 0.44-0.49] and 0.69 [0.68-0.70] for children aged 0-5 years and 6-17 years, respectively. Similarly, the incidence rate ratio was 0.09 [0.08-0.09], 0.31 [0.30-0.32], 0.64 [0.63-0.66], and 1.07 [1.05-1.10] for children aged 0-5 years, 6-10 years, 11-14 years, and 15-17 years, respectively. Children and adolescents accounted for 1.9% of the newly hospitalized patients between W34 and W42, and for 1.3% of new intensive care admissions. No death was observed. Among infected children and adolescents, the percentage of asymptomatic individuals was 57% at W34 and 48% at W42. The number of schools closed remained low, less than 1% throughout the study period. The number of confirmed cases among school staff was consistent with the data measured in the general population.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Life expectancy has grown tremendously. This incredible achievement for mankind has been obtained mostly thanks to three pillars: hygiene, antibiotics and vaccines. They represent one of the most effective forms of medical intervention. From Jenner's work to new vaccines, immunization has reduced the consequences of infectious diseases. In the last years antimicrobial resistance (AMR) as well as emerging infectious diseases have been rated as major threats for our society, as their toll is forecasted to drastically impinge on human health and economies. Indeed, recently, the whole world has experienced such problems because of the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of Covid-19. Herein, we propose an excursus through the three main pillars (hygiene, antibiotics and vaccination) that contributed to improving life expectancy, their clinical and economic impact and the role of vaccines to fight AMR-related diseases and emerging infectious diseases like Covid-19.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"">The COVID-19 outbreak was first reported to the World Health Organization on December 31, 2019, and it was officially declared a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020. The COVID-19 outbreak and the safety measures taken to control it caused many psychological issues in populations worldwide, such as depression, anxiety, and stress.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""OBJECTIVE"" NlmCategory=""OBJECTIVE"">The objectives of this study were to assess the psychological effects of the lockdown due to the COVID-19 outbreak on university students in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and to investigate the students' awareness of mobile mental health care apps as well as their attitudes toward the use of these apps.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">A two-part self-administered web-based questionnaire was delivered to students at United Arab Emirates University. The first part of the questionnaire assessed the mental state of the participants using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), while the second part contained questions investigating the participants' awareness of and attitudes toward mental health care apps. Students were invited to fill out the web-based questionnaire via social media and mailing lists.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">A total of 154 students participated in the survey, and the majority were female. The results of the GHQ-12 analysis showed that the students were experiencing psychological issues related to depression and anxiety as well as social dysfunction. The results also revealed a lack of awareness of mental health care apps and uncertainty regarding the use of such apps. Approximately one-third of the participants (44/154, 28.6%) suggested preferred functionalities and characteristics of mobile mental health care apps, such as affordable price, simple design, ease of use, web-based therapy, communication with others experiencing the same issues, and tracking of mental status.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Like many groups of people worldwide, university students in the UAE were psychologically affected by the lockdown due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Although apps can be useful tools for mental health care delivery, especially in circumstances such as those produced by the outbreak, the students in this study showed a lack of awareness of these apps and mixed attitudes toward them. Improving the digital health literacy of university students in the UAE by increasing their awareness of mental health care apps and the treatment methods and benefits of the apps, as well as involving students in the app creation process, may encourage students to use these tools for mental health care.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>We performed RNA-seq and high-resolution mass spectrometry on 128 blood samples from COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative patients with diverse disease severities and outcomes. Quantified transcripts, proteins, metabolites, and lipids were associated with clinical outcomes in a curated relational database, uniquely enabling systems analysis and cross-ome correlations to molecules and patient prognoses. We mapped 219 molecular features with high significance to COVID-19 status and severity, many of which were involved in complement activation, dysregulated lipid transport, and neutrophil activation. We identified sets of covarying molecules, e.g., protein gelsolin and metabolite citrate or plasmalogens and apolipoproteins, offering pathophysiological insights and therapeutic suggestions. The observed dysregulation of platelet function, blood coagulation, acute phase response, and endotheliopathy further illuminated the unique COVID-19 phenotype.

                <AbstractText><b>Aim:</b> To prevent shedding of the novel COVID-19 virus in hospitals, strict hygiene measures and surveillance of the staff and patients is mandatory. Studying the available literature, we assumed that monitoring of the cleaning staff may sometimes be a ""blind spot"" in surveillance. Although the cleaning personnel is not entrusted with the medical and nursing care of patients, the extent of patient contacts in this group may be comparable to medical personnel and even increase in times of a visit ban in many hospitals. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of COVID-19 infections already undergone in this group. <b>Methods:</b> Antibody titers (IgA and IgG) against COVID-19 were measured in the cleaning staff from June 15<sup>th</sup> to 30<sup>th</sup>, 2020 in our clinic. Antibodies against COVID-19 were determined using ELISA (EUROIMMUN™, PerkinElmer, Inc. Company). For purposes of comparison, the same procedure was performed in the staff of the oncology ward, who were regarded as an important group due to their high-risk patients. <b>Results:</b> During the study period, 45 members of the cleaning staff and 20 members of the oncology ward were tested. Significantly elevated IgA antibody titers were detected in 1 person in the first group and in 1 person in the second group. Significantly elevated IgG antibody titers were not detected in the first group and in 1 person of the second group. In case of positive or indeterminate testing, swabs for direct virus detection were taken, but were negative in all cases. <b>Conclusion:</b> The prevalence of already undergone infections in both groups is low, as to be expected due to the still low incidence of COVID-19 infections in the German federal state of Thuringia. However, the presence of such antibodies in the cleaning personnel demonstrates the need for equally strict surveillance in this group.</AbstractText>

TDDS are more convenient and less invasive tools for disease and viral infection treatment, prevention, detection, and surveillance. The emerging development of microneedles for TDDS has facilitated improved skin barrier penetration for the delivery of macromolecules or hydrophilic drugs. Microneedle TDDS patches can be fabricated to deliver virus vaccines and potentially provide a viable alternative vaccine modality that offers improved immunogenicity, thermostability, simplicity, safety, and compliance as well as sharp-waste reduction, increased cost-effectiveness, and the capacity for self-administration, which could improve vaccine distribution. These advantages make TDDS-based vaccine delivery an especially well-suited option for treatment of widespread viral infectious diseases including pandemics. Because microneedle-based bioassays employ transdermal extraction of interstitial fluid or blood, they can be used as a minimally invasive approach for surveying disease markers and providing point-of-care (POC) diagnostics. For cutaneous viral infections, TDDS can provide localized treatment with high specificity and less systemic toxicity. In summary, TDDS, especially those that employ microneedles, possess special attributes that can be leveraged to reduce morbidity and mortality from viral infectious diseases. In this regard, they may have considerable positive impact as a modality for improving global health. In this article, we introduce the possible role and summarize the current literature regarding TDDS applications for fighting common cutaneous or systemic viral infectious diseases, including herpes simplex, varicella or herpes zoster, warts, influenza, measles, and COVID-19.</AbstractText></Abstract>",1,2021-07-06 00:00:00

A 32-item online survey encompassing demographic characteristics, sport and university engagement, support and dual-career benefits, physical activity, sitting time, and the time deemed necessary to recover the previous level of performance was developed. Four hundred sixty-seven student-athletes (males: 57%, females: 43%) from 11 countries, competing in 49 different sports (individual: 63.4%, team: 36.6%) at regional (17.5%), national (43.3%), and international (39.2%) levels, and enrolled at high school (21.9%) and university (78.1%) levels completed the survey. During the lockdown, the respondents decreased the time dedicated to sport and academics, although they maintained an active lifestyle. Student-athletes from countries under severe contagion were more likely to train at home, dedicate to academics, and receive support from the coach but less likely receive support from their teachers. With respect to their team sport counterparts, athletes competing in individual sports trained more and were more likely to receive support from their coaches. International athletes showed the highest training time and support from their coaches and as student-athletes. High school students received more support from their coaches and teachers, whereas university students were more likely considering dual careers useful to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. This study substantiates the relevant role of competitive sports participation in the maintenance of active lifestyles, with student-athletes considering home training and e-learning valuable resources during the lockdown. Furthermore, their sport and academic commitments helped student-athletes cope with the emergency of the COVID-19 pandemic.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>The recently discovered coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which was detected in Wuhan, China, has spread worldwide and is still being studied at the end of 2019. Detection of COVID-19 at an early stage is essential to provide adequate healthcare to affected patients and protect the uninfected community. This paper aims to design and develop a novel ensemble-based classifier to predict COVID-19 cases at a very early stage so that appropriate action can be taken by patients, doctors, health organizations, and the government. In this paper, a synthetic dataset of COVID-19 is generated by a dataset generation algorithm. A novel ensemble-based classifier of machine learning is employed on the COVID-19 dataset to predict the disease. A convex hull-based approach is also applied to the data to improve the proposed novel, ensemble-based classifier's accuracy and speed. The model is designed and developed through the python programming language and compares with the most popular classifier, i.e., Decision Tree, ID3, and support vector machine. The results indicate that the proposed novel classifier provides a more significant precision, kappa static, root means a square error, recall, F-measure, and accuracy.</AbstractText>

Spatial variations were observed for both COVID-19 death outcomes and long-term ambient air pollutant levels. County-level average NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations were positively associated with both COVID-19 case-fatality rate and mortality rate in single-, bi-, and tri-pollutant models (p-values&lt;0.05). Per inter-quartile range (IQR) increase in NO<sub>2</sub> (4.6 ppb), COVID-19 case-fatality rate and mortality rate were associated with an increase of 7.1% (95% CI 1.2% to 13.4%) and 11.2% (95% CI 3.4% to 19.5%), respectively. We did not observe significant associations between long-term exposures to PM<sub>2.5</sub> or O<sub>3</sub> and COVID-19 death outcomes (p-values&gt;0.05), although per IQR increase in PM<sub>2.5</sub> (3.4 ug/m<sup>3</sup>) was marginally associated with 10.8% (95% CI: -1.1% to 24.1%) increase in COVID-19 mortality rate.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""Discussions and Conclusions"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">Long-term exposure to NO<sub>2</sub>, which largely arises from urban combustion sources such as traffic, may enhance susceptibility to severe COVID-19 outcomes, independent of long-term PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> exposure. The results support targeted public health actions to protect residents from COVID-19 in heavily polluted regions with historically high NO<sub>2</sub> levels. Moreover, continuation of current efforts to lower traffic emissions and ambient air pollution levels may be an important component of reducing population-level risk of COVID-19 deaths.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>COVID-19 is a disease caused by the SARS-CoV virus. It stands for severe acute respiratory syndrome, which affects the lungs. The process of replication and progression of the COVID-19 virus causes the formation of an excessive amount of reactive oxygen species and inflammation. Many studies have been carried out that have demonstrated that hydrogen has strong anti-inflammatory properties. It reduces hypotension and other symptoms by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress. Oxygen mixture, enriched with Hydrogen, - helps to reduce the resistance of the respiratory tract and frees up access to the pulmonary alveolus, which improves the penetration of oxygen into the lungs. Since hydrogen is an antioxidant, it helps to reduce the burden on the immune system, helps to maintain the body's health and its ability to quickly recover. When electrolysers are used to produce an oxygen-hydrogen mixture, alkaline mist and other impurities can enter the patient's lungs and cause poisoning and chemical burns. For this reason, the use of atomic hydrogen obtained from metal hydride sources for ventilation of the lungs will be more effective for treating COVID-19 than a molecular hydrogen-oxygen mixture from an electrolyzer. A functional diagram of a metal hydride source of atomic hydrogen to an artificial lung ventilator is shown. It is possible to create a series of hydrogen storage tanks of various capacities.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">This is a retrospective single-center study of patients with COVID-19 diagnosed via reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay admitted between March 1, 2020, and April 24, 2020. An analysis of the utilization of palliative care in accordance with patient comorbidities and other characteristics was performed while considering clinical outcomes. Chi-square test was used to determine associations between categorical variables while t-tests were used to compare continuous variables.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">The overall mortality rate was 21.5% (n = 52), and in 48% (n = 25) of these patients, palliative care was not involved. Fifty-nine percent (n = 24) of those who had palliative consults eventually elected for comfort measures and transitioned to hospice care. Among those classified as having severe COVID-19, only 40% (n = 31) had palliative care involvement. Of these patients with severe COVID-19, 68% (n = 52) died. Patients who got palliative care consults were of older age, had higher rates of intubation, a need for vasopressors, and were dead.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">There was a low utilization rate of palliative care in patients with COVID-19. Conscious utilization of palliative care is needed at the time of COVID-19.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>The pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is causing enormous loss of life globally. Prompt case identification is critical. The reference method is the real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assay, whose limitations may curb its prompt large-scale application. COVID-19 manifests with chest computed tomography (CT) abnormalities, some even before the onset of symptoms. We tested the hypothesis that the application of deep learning (DL) to 3D CT images could help identify COVID-19 infections. Using data from 920 COVID-19 and 1,073 non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients, we developed a modified DenseNet-264 model, COVIDNet, to classify CT images to either class. When tested on an independent set of 233 COVID-19 and 289 non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients, COVIDNet achieved an accuracy rate of 94.3% and an area under the curve of 0.98. As of March 23, 2020, the COVIDNet system had been used 11,966 times with a sensitivity of 91.12% and a specificity of 88.50% in six hospitals with PCR confirmation. Application of DL to CT images may improve both efficiency and capacity of case detection and long-term surveillance.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label=""METHOD AND MATERIALS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">We collected data on blood donations and RBC inventory for the first 8 weeks of the outbreak. We also evaluated the trend of blood donations and RBC inventory and compared them with the data of the past year. We include a summary of actions taken by the National Committee on Management of COVID-19 outbreak.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">Blood donations decreased from 33 275 to 23 465 units during the first 2 weeks of the outbreak with a corresponding decrease in the RBC inventory. But after that, donations gradually increased from 23 465 to 29 665 units. RBC inventory levels improved at the same time. Then, the Iranian New Year's holiday resulted in another downward trend. After the holiday, blood donations revived, along with the RBC inventory.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""DISCUSSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Although it appears that this virus cannot be transmitted through transfusion, changes in lifestyle had a significant impact on reducing blood supply. Following implemented measures, we saw an upward trend in blood donations and an adequate supply of RBC units in blood centres, helped by a reduction in demand by hospitals. Blood centres need to be more prepared to manage future viral disasters, especially in case of transfusion-transmissible infections.</AbstractText>

However, traditional and novel antiviral discovery approaches are unable to mitigate them in a timely manner. Notably, drug repurposing emerged as an alternative strategy to provide antiviral solutions in a timely and cost-effective manner. In the literature, many FDA-approved drugs have been repurposed to inhibit viruses, while a few among them have also entered clinical trials. Using experimental data, we identified repurposed drugs against 14 viruses responsible for causing epidemics and pandemics such as SARS-CoV-2, SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome, influenza H1N1, Ebola, Zika, Nipah, chikungunya, and others. We developed a novel computational ""drug-target-drug"" approach that uses the drug-targets extracted for specific drugs, which are experimentally validated in vitro or in vivo for antiviral activity. Furthermore, these extracted drug-targets were used to fetch the novel FDA-approved drugs for each virus and prioritize them by calculating their confidence scores. Pathway analysis showed that the majority of the extracted targets are involved in cancer and signaling pathways. For SARS-CoV-2, our method identified 21 potential repurposed drugs, of which 7 (e.g., baricitinib, ramipril, chlorpromazine, enalaprilat, etc.) have already entered clinical trials. The prioritized drug candidates were further validated using a molecular docking approach. Therefore, we anticipate success during the experimental validation of our predicted FDA-approved repurposed drugs against 14 viruses. This study will assist the scientific community in hastening research aimed at the development of antiviral therapeutics.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

We found that science mindsets increased whereas faith mindsets decreased (regardless of religious type) during the early months of the pandemic. Further, bivariate correlations and autoregressive cross-lagged analyses indicated that science mindset was positive predictor of COVID-19 concern, in support of Model 2. Faith mindset was not associated with COVID-19 concern. However, faith mindset was a negative predictor of science mindset.

We explore the US healthcare system as it pertains to dialysis care, including existing policies, modifications implemented in response to the coronavirus disease-2019 crisis, and possible next steps for policy makers and nephrologists. This includes policies related to resource management, use of telemedicine, prioritization of dialysis access procedures, expansion of home dialysis modalities, administrative duties, and quality assessment. The government has already established policies that have instated some flexibilities to help providers focus their response to the crisis. However, future policy during and after the coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic can bolster our ability to optimize care for patients with end-stage kidney disease. Key themes in this perspective are the importance of policy flexibility, clear strategies for emergency preparedness, and robust health systems that maximize accessibility and patient autonomy.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Wearing a face mask is a major issue in the fight against the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The French general population widely started to wear this personal protective equipment usually dedicated to healthcare workers, without being educated to its correct use. People base their behaviour on what they see in the media. However, we observed that mask wearing of healthcare workers published in the media during the pandemic only conformed to good practice guidelines in 70.8% of the photographs collected on some of the main French information websites. Health authorities should communicate widely regarding the good practices for mask wearing in the general population.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText><b>Background:</b> The severity of the Coronavirus pandemic has led to lockdowns in different countries to reduce the spread of the infection. These lockdown restrictions are likely to be detrimental to mental health and well-being in adolescents. Physical activity can be beneficial for mental health and well-being; however, research has yet to examine associations between adolescent physical activity and mental health and well-being during lockdown. <b>Purpose:</b> Examine the effects of adolescent perceived Coronavirus prevalence and fear on mental health and well-being and investigate the extent to which physical activity can be a protective factor against these concerns. <b>Methods:</b> During United Kingdom lockdown restrictions, 165 participants (100 female, aged 13-19) completed an online questionnaire assessing perceived Coronavirus prevalence and fear, physical activity, and indicators of mental health and well-being (stress, anxiety, depression, fatigue, vitality, and perceived health). Separate hierarchical multiple linear regression analyses (with age, gender, perceived Coronavirus prevalence, and fear entered in step 1, and physical activity in step 2) were run to predict each well-being outcome. <b>Results:</b> Regression analyses indicated that in general, while Coronavirus fear was a negative predictor, physical activity was a positive and stronger predictor of enhanced mental health and well-being outcomes. <b>Conclusion:</b> Findings suggest that physical activity during the Coronavirus pandemic can counteract the negative effects of Coronavirus fear on adolescent mental health and well-being. Therefore, physical activity should be promoted during lockdown to support good mental health and well-being.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>There are no commercially available effective antiviral medications or vaccines to deal with novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Hence there is a substantial unmet medical need for new and efficacious treatment options for COVID-19. Most COVID-19 deaths result from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This virus induces excessive and aberrant inflammation so it is important to control the inflammation as soon as possible. To date, results of numerous studies have been shown that mesenchymal stem cells and their derivatives can suppress inflammation. Exosomes function as intercellular communication vehicles to transfer bioactive molecules (based on their origins), between cells. In this review, the recent exosome-based clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19 are presented. Potential therapy may include the following items: First, using mesenchymal stem cells secretome. Second, incorporating specific miRNAs and mRNAs into exosomes and last, using exosomes as carriers to deliver drugs.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>The emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected more than 62 million people worldwide. Control responses varied across countries with different outcomes in terms of epidemic size and social disruption. This study presents an age-specific susceptible-exposed-infected-recovery-death model that considers the unique characteristics of COVID-19 to examine the effectiveness of various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in New York City (NYC). Numerical experiments from our model show that the control policies implemented in NYC reduced the number of infections by 72% [interquartile range (IQR) 53-95] and the number of deceased cases by 76% (IQR 58-96) by the end of 2020. Among all the NPIs, social distancing for the entire population and protection for the elderly in public facilities is the most effective control measure in reducing severe infections and deceased cases. School closure policy may not work as effectively as one might expect in terms of reducing the number of deceased cases. Our simulation results provide novel insights into the city-specific implementation of NPIs with minimal social disruption considering the locations and population characteristics.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>The novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) is a contagious acute respiratory infectious disease whose causative agent has been demonstrated to be a novel virus of the coronavirus family, SARSCoV-2. A recent PRE-print study has showed a heme attack on the 1-beta chain of hemoglobin by COVID19. Beta-thalassemia results of a default in the hemoglobin beta-chain synthesis. 1,5% global population are heterozygotes for this disease. In this study, by a multiple linear regression, we have analyzed the evolution of COVID-19 infection in three Italian regions (Puglia, Sardinia, Sicilia) with different beta-thalassemic prevalences, in order to search a link. The results have showed that betathalassemic heterozygote population prevalence is correlated to immunity against COVID-19, by a regression.

Approximately 5% of COVID-19 patients develop severe illness, and approximately 40% of those with severe illness eventually die, corresponding to more than 2.78 million people. The pathological characteristics of COVID-19 resemble typical sepsis, and severe COVID-19 has been identified as viral sepsis. Progress in sepsis research is important for improving the clinical care of these patients. Recent advances in understanding the pathogenesis of sepsis have led to the view that an uncontrolled inflammatory response and oxidative stress are core factors. However, in the traditional treatment of sepsis, it is difficult to achieve a balance between the inflammation, pathogens (viruses, bacteria, and fungi), and patient tolerance, resulting in high mortality of patients with sepsis. In recent years, nanomaterials mediating reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) and the inflammatory response have shown previously unattainable therapeutic effects on sepsis. Despite these advantages, RONS and inflammatory response-based nanomaterials have yet to be extensively adopted as sepsis therapy. To the best of our knowledge, no review has yet discussed the pathogenesis of sepsis and the application of nanomaterials. To help bridge this gap, we discuss the pathogenesis of sepsis related to inflammation and the overproduction RONS, which activate pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-pattern recognition receptor (PRR) and damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP)-PRR signaling pathways. We also summarize the application of nanomaterials in the treatment of sepsis. As highlighted here, this strategy could synergistically improve the therapeutic efficacy against both RONS and inflammation in sepsis and may prolong survival. Current challenges and future developments for sepsis treatment are also summarized.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

                <AbstractText>The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak has caused a large number of deaths with thousands of confirmed cases worldwide, especially in East Asia. This study took an immunoinformatics approach to identify significant cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and B cell epitopes in the 2019-nCoV surface glycoprotein. Also, interactions between identified CTL epitopes and their corresponding major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I supertype representatives prevalent in China were studied by molecular dynamics simulations. We identified five CTL epitopes, three sequential B cell epitopes and five discontinuous B cell epitopes in the viral surface glycoprotein. Also, during simulations, the CTL epitopes were observed to be binding MHC class I peptide-binding grooves via multiple contacts, with continuous hydrogen bonds and salt bridge anchors, indicating their potential in generating immune responses. Some of these identified epitopes can be potential candidates for the development of 2019-nCoV vaccines.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was declared a worldwide pandemic in 2020. Infection triggers the respiratory tract disease COVID-19, which is accompanied by serious changes in clinical biomarkers such as hemoglobin and interleukins. The same parameters are altered during hemolysis, which is characterized by an increase in labile heme. We present two computational-experimental approaches aimed at analyzing a potential link between heme-related and COVID-19 pathophysiologies. Herein, we performed a detailed analysis of the common pathways induced by heme and SARS-CoV-2 by superimposition of knowledge graphs covering heme biology and COVID-19 pathophysiology. Focus was laid on inflammatory pathways and distinct biomarkers as the linking elements. In a second approach, four COVID-19-related proteins, the host cell proteins ACE2 and TMPRSS2 as well as the viral proteins 7a and S protein were computationally analyzed as potential heme-binding proteins with an experimental validation. The results contribute to the understanding of the progression of COVID-19 infections in patients with different clinical backgrounds and may allow for a more individual diagnosis and therapy in the future.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>The COVID-19 pandemic presents the worst public health crisis in recent history. The response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been challenged by many factors, including scientific uncertainties, scarcity of relevant research, proliferation of misinformation and fake news, poor access to actionable evidence, time constraints, and weak collaborations among relevant stakeholders. Knowledge translation (KT) platforms, composed of organisations, initiatives and networks supporting evidence-informed policy-making, can play an important role in providing relevant and timely evidence to inform pandemic responses and bridge the gap between science, policy, practice and politics. In this Commentary, we highlight the emerging roles of KT platforms in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. We also reflect on the lessons learned from the efforts of a KT platform in a middle-income country to inform decision-making and practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. The lessons learned can be integrated into strengthening the role, structures and mandates of KT platforms as hubs for trustworthy evidence that can inform policies and practice during public health crises and in promoting their integration and institutionalisation within the policy-making processes.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>International societies like the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR), American Heart Association (AHA), and UK Resuscitation Council have suggested modified guidelines for resuscitation during coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Though there is consensus in most of the recommendations there are also disparities. Considering the rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic and our better understanding of the spread of the disease, there is an urgent need to suggest modifications to the existing guidelines. These modifications should allay the fear of health care workers regarding their safety and reluctance to provide cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) but should also address the serious concerns where an opportunity is lost to revive patients who may not be COVID positive as suspected.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Many public officials are calling for increased testing for the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and some governments have taken extraordinary measures to increase the availability of testing. However, little has been published about the sensitivity and specificity of the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) nasopharyngeal swabs that are commonly used for testing. This narrative review evaluates the literature regarding the accuracy of these tests, and makes recommendations based on this literature. In brief, a negative RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab test is insufficient to rule out COVID-19. Thus, over-reliance on the results of the test may be dangerous, and the push for widespread testing may be overstated.</AbstractText>

Early reports that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was detectable in wastewater in advance of confirmed cases sparked widespread interest in wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) as a tool for mitigation of COVID-19 outbreaks. One hypothesis was that wastewater surveillance might provide a cost-effective alternative to other more expensive approaches such as pooled and random testing of groups. In this paper, we report the outcomes of a wastewater surveillance pilot program at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, a large urban university with a substantial population of students living in on-campus dormitories. Surveillance was conducted at the building level on a thrice-weekly schedule throughout the university's fall residential semester. In multiple cases, wastewater surveillance enabled the identification of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases that were not detected by other components of the campus monitoring program, which also included in-house contact tracing, symptomatic testing, scheduled testing of student athletes, and daily symptom reporting. In the context of all cluster events reported to the University community during the fall semester, wastewater-based testing events resulted in the identification of smaller clusters than were reported in other types of cluster events. Wastewater surveillance was able to detect single asymptomatic individuals in dorms with resident populations of 150-200. While the strategy described was developed for COVID-19, it is likely to be applicable to mitigation of future pandemics in universities and other group-living environments.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

                <AbstractText>The COVID-19 pandemic, despite the restrictions and preventive measures applied, has rapidly spread and reached Poland. The adaptation to the dynamically changing epidemiological situation requires a prompt implementation of effective preventive measures. The aim of the publication is to provide current knowledge to all persons involved in the preventive care system, i.e., employees, employers and professionals of occupational medicine, about the epidemiological situation related to SARS‑CoV- 2, as well as recommendations and possible solutions. In order to analyze these issues, a review of literature was conducted based on medical research databases: PubMed, SCOPUS, and the Web of Science Core Collection. The literature was supplemented with studies found on websites of the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization. Data on the cases of and deaths due to COVID-19 come from reports provided by the Ministry of Health, data published on the websites of the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, and ourworldindata.org. By the time of submitting the publication, 34 154 cases and 1444 deaths due to coronavirus had been recorded in Poland. Data from published studies suggest that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplets or through contact with contaminated objects and surfaces. Therefore, in the absence of an effective vaccine, preventive actions are based mainly on strategies that minimize the risk of pathogen transmission. In addition to discussing the current epidemiological situation, diagnostic procedures, risk groups and COVID-19 characteristics, the paper presents recommendations and proposed solutions for employers and employees regarding the prevention of SARS‑CoV- 2, along with currently applicable laws and recommendations on employee prophylactic examinations during the pandemic. Subsequently, COVID-19 was discussed in the aspect of an occupational disease and other health threats related to the pandemics. The epidemiological situation regarding coronavirus indicates the need to take immediate and effective actions to minimize infection transmission among employees, and to develop procedures for a quick and effective ability to locate the COVID-19 outbreaks in workplaces.

This is an intriguing problem, because the US has historically lacked a standardized set of telehealth coverage and reimbursement policies, which has posed a barrier to telehealth use across all specialties. Although all medical specialties in the US have been affected by these <i>macro</i> (policy-level) barriers, some specialties have been able to integrate telehealth use into mainstream practice, while others are just gaining momentum with telehealth during COVID-19. Although the temporary removal of policy (coverage) restrictions during the pandemic has accelerated telehealth use, uncertainties remain regarding future telehealth sustainability. Since <i>macro</i> (policy-level) factors by themselves do not serve to explain the variation in telehealth use across specialties, it would be important to examine <i>meso</i> (organizational-level) and <i>micro</i> (individual-level) factors historically influencing telehealth use across specialties, to understand underlying reasons for variation and identify implications for widespread sustainability. This paper draws upon the existing literature to develop a conceptual framework on <i>macro-meso-micro</i> factors influencing telehealth use within a medical specialty. The framework is then used to guide a narrative review of the telehealth literature across six medical specialties, including three specialties with lower telehealth use (allergy-immunology, family medicine, gastroenterology) and three with higher telehealth use (psychiatry, cardiology, radiology) in the US, in order to synthesize themes and gain insights into barriers and facilitators to telehealth use. In doing so, this review addresses a gap in the literature and provides a foundation for future research. Importantly, it helps to identify implications for ensuring widespread sustainability of telehealth use in the post-pandemic future.</AbstractText></Abstract>",0,2021-06-07 00:00:00

                <AbstractText>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a pandemic. Peritoneal dialysis (PD), being a home therapy, allows for physical distancing measures and movement restrictions. In order to prevent COVID-19 contagioun among the Dominican Republic National Health System PD program patients, a follow-up virtual protocol for this group was developed. The aim of this study is to outline the protocol established by the PD program's healthcare team using telemedicine in order to avoid COVID-19 transmission and to report initial results and outcomes of this initiative. This is an observational prospective longitudinal study with 946 patients being treated in seven centers distributed throughout the country between April 1 and June 30. The protocol was implemented focusing on the patient follow-up; risk mitigation data were registered and collected from electronic records. During the follow-up period, 95 catheters were implanted, 64 patients initiated PD, and the remaining were in training. A total of 9532 consultations were given by the different team specialists, with 8720 (91%) virtual and 812 (9%) face-to-face consultations. The transfer rate to hemodialysis was 0.29%, whereas the peritonitis rate was 0.11 episode per patient/year. Eighteen adults tested positive for COVID-19. The implementation of the protocol and telemedicine utilization have ensured follow-up and monitoring, preserved therapy, controlled complications, and PD lives protected.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>The rapid spread of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) confronts policy makers with the problem of measuring the effectiveness of containment strategies, balancing public health considerations with the economic costs of social distancing measures. We introduce a modified epidemic model that we name the controlled-SIR model, in which the disease reproduction rate evolves dynamically in response to political and societal reactions. An analytic solution is presented. The model reproduces official COVID-19 cases counts of a large number of regions and countries that surpassed the first peak of the outbreak. A single unbiased feedback parameter is extracted from field data and used to formulate an index that measures the efficiency of containment strategies (the CEI index). CEI values for a range of countries are given. For two variants of the controlled-SIR model, detailed estimates of the total medical and socio-economic costs are evaluated over the entire course of the epidemic. Costs comprise medical care cost, the economic cost of social distancing, as well as the economic value of lives saved. Under plausible parameters, strict measures fare better than a hands-off policy. Strategies based on current case numbers lead to substantially higher total costs than strategies based on the overall history of the epidemic.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">Fifty-eight fragrance materials, which are classified as allergen fragrance molecules, were selected and used in this study. Docking simulations were carried out using four functional proteins; the Covid19 Main Protase (MPro), Receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein, Nucleocapsid, and host Bromodomain protein (BRD2), as target macromolecules. Three different software, AutoDock, AutoDock Vina (Vina), and Molegro Virtual Docker (MVD), running a total of four different docking protocol with optimized energy functions were used. Results were compared with the five molecules reported in the literature as potential drugs against COVID-19. Virtual screening was carried out using Vina, molecules satisfying our cut-off (- 6.5 kcal/mol) binding affinity was confirmed by MVD. Selected molecules were analyzed using the flexible docking protocol of Vina and AutoDock default settings.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">Ten out of 58 allergen fragrance molecules were selected for further docking studies. MPro and BRD2 are potential targets for the tested allergen fragrance molecules, while RBD and Nucleocapsid showed weak binding energies. According to AutoDock results, three molecules, Benzyl Cinnamate, Dihydroambrettolide, and Galaxolide, had good binding affinities to BRD2. While Dihydroambrettolide and Galaxolide showed the potential to bind to MPro, Sclareol and Vertofix had the best calculated binding affinities to this target. When the flexible docking results analyzed, all the molecules tested had better calculated binding affinities as expected. Benzyl Benzoate and Benzyl Salicylate showed good binding affinities to BRD2. In the case of MPro, Sclareol had the lowest binding affinity among all the tested allergen fragrance molecules.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>PARP1, the major isoform of a family of ADP-ribosylating enzymes, has been implicated in the regulation of various biological processes including DNA repair, gene transcription, and cell death. The concept that PARP1 becomes activated in acute lung injury (ALI) and that pharmacological inhibition or genetic deletion of this enzyme can provide therapeutic benefits emerged over 20 years ago. The current article provides an overview of the cellular mechanisms involved in the pathogenetic roles of PARP1 in ALI and provides an overview of the preclinical data supporting the efficacy of PARP (poly[ADP-ribose] polymerase) inhibitors. In recent years, several ultrapotent PARP inhibitors have been approved for clinical use (for the therapy of various oncological diseases): these newly-approved PARP inhibitors were recently reported to show efficacy in animal models of ALI. These observations offer the possibility of therapeutic repurposing of these inhibitors for patients with ALI. The current article lays out a potential roadmap for such repurposing efforts.

                <AbstractText Label=""Background"">The COVID-19 pandemic has affected all sectors of the world economy and society. To understand the impact of the pandemic on firms in China and suggest public policies to deal with the negative effects, we investigated firms in Guangdong Province.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""Methods"">The survey sample included 524 firms in 15 cities in Guangdong Province. We chose these firms from the list published by the government, considering the industrial characteristics of Guangdong province and firm size. The questionnaire was developed based on previous studies carried out by UNDP. It comprised four categories with a total of 17 questions. The executives of firms were contacted by telephone or WeChat, and were invited to answer self-administered questionnaires through an online survey platform. The data was analyzed by SPSS.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""Results"">The following key findings were revealed through the survey: (1) 48.7% of firms maintained stability, and 35.1% experienced a halt in operation or faced closure; (2) Nearly 70-90% already exploit online commerce or are willing to do so, and also remote office work, and digital operations. (3) 46% believe that they will certainly incur losses for 2020, and 83.5% expect the city's GDP to decrease.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""Conclusions"">Firms in Guangdong Province have faced great challenges in the epidemic. Their production and operation activities have been limited, and they are facing significant risks. It is necessary to implement policies that would profoundly lower production costs for firms, help them survive this difficult period, and gradually return to normal business.</AbstractText>

The risk for specific new sequelae attributable to SARS-Cov-2 infection after the acute phase, including chronic respiratory failure, cardiac arrythmia, hypercoagulability, encephalopathy, peripheral neuropathy, amnesia (memory difficulty), diabetes, liver test abnormalities, myocarditis, anxiety, and fatigue, was significantly greater than in the three comparator groups (2020, 2019, and viral lower respiratory tract illness groups) (all P&lt;0.001). Significant risk differences because of SARS-CoV-2 infection ranged from 0.02 to 2.26 per 100 people (all P&lt;0.001), and hazard ratios ranged from 1.24 to 25.65 compared with the 2020 comparator group.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">The results indicate the excess risk of developing new clinical sequelae after the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including specific types of sequelae less commonly seen in other viral illnesses. Although individuals who were older, had pre-existing conditions, and were admitted to hospital because of covid-19 were at greatest excess risk, younger adults (aged ≤50), those with no pre-existing conditions, or those not admitted to hospital for covid-19 also had an increased risk of developing new clinical sequelae. The greater risk for incident sequelae after the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection is relevant for healthcare planning.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

                <AbstractText Label=""AIMS"" NlmCategory=""OBJECTIVE"">During the COVID-19 pandemic, hospital admissions for cardiac care have declined. However, effects on mortality are unclear. Thus, we sought to evaluate the impact of the lockdown period in central Germany on overall and cardiovascular deaths. Simultaneously we looked at catheterization activities in the same region.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""METHODS AND RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">Data from 22 of 24 public health-authorities in central Germany were aggregated during the pandemic related lockdown period and compared to the same time period in 2019. Information on the total number of deaths and causes of death, including cardiovascular mortality, were collected. Additionally, we compared rates of hospitalization (n = 5178) for chronic coronary syndrome (CCS), acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in 26 hospitals in this area. Data on 5,984 deaths occurring between March 23, 2020 and April 26, 2020 were evaluated. In comparison to the reference non-pandemic period in 2019 (deaths: n = 5832), there was a non-significant increase in all-cause mortality of 2.6% [incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99-1.06; p = 0.16]. Cardiovascular and cardiac mortality increased significantly by 7.6% (IRR 1.08, 95%-CI 1.01-1.14; p = 0.02) and by 11.8% (IRR 1.12, 95%-CI 1.05-1.19; p &lt; 0.001), respectively. During the same period, our data revealed a drop in cardiac catherization procedures.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">During the COVID-19-related lockdown a significant increase in cardiovascular mortality was observed in central Germany, whereas catherization activities were reduced. The mechanisms underlying both of these observations should be investigated further in order to better understand the effects of a pandemic-related lockdown and social-distancing restrictions on cardiovascular care and mortality.</AbstractText>

In the current study, we formulated protein subunit vaccines with AS03 adjuvant and recombinant proteins of S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 (S1-WT) and S1 variant (K417N, E484K, N501Y, and D614G) subunit (S1-Mut), and immunized transgenic mice that express human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). The S1 protein-specific antibody production and the neutralization capability for SARS-CoV-2 and B.1.351 variant were measured after immunization in mice. The results revealed that the S1-Mut antigens were more effective in inhibiting the receptor-binding domain and ACE2 binding in B.1.351 variant than in wild-type SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the development of a bivalent vaccine exhibited the ideal neutralization properties against wild-type and B.1.351 variant, as well as other variants. Our findings may provide a rationale for the development of a bivalent recombinant vaccine targeting the S1 protein that can induce the neutralizing antibodies against both SARS-CoV-2 variants and wild-type of the virus and may be of importance to explore the potential clinical use of bivalent recombinant vaccine in the future.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>© 2021 The Authors.

While the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the gold standard method for detecting active SARS-CoV-2 infection, alternative high-throughput diagnostic tests are of a significant value to meet universal testing demands. Here, we describe a new design of the MasSpec Pen technology integrated to electrospray ionization (ESI) for direct analysis of clinical swabs and investigate its use for COVID-19 screening. The redesigned MasSpec Pen system incorporates a disposable sampling device refined for uniform and efficient analysis of swab tips via liquid extraction directly coupled to an ESI source. Using this system, we analyzed nasopharyngeal swabs from 244 individuals including symptomatic COVID-19 positive, symptomatic negative, and asymptomatic negative individuals, enabling rapid detection of rich lipid profiles. Two statistical classifiers were generated based on the lipid information acquired. Classifier 1 was built to distinguish symptomatic PCR-positive from asymptomatic PCR-negative individuals, yielding a cross-validation accuracy of 83.5%, sensitivity of 76.6%, and specificity of 86.6%, and validation set accuracy of 89.6%, sensitivity of 100%, and specificity of 85.3%. Classifier 2 was built to distinguish symptomatic PCR-positive patients from negative individuals including symptomatic PCR-negative patients with moderate to severe symptoms and asymptomatic individuals, yielding a cross-validation accuracy of 78.4%, specificity of 77.21%, and sensitivity of 81.8%. Collectively, this study suggests that the lipid profiles detected directly from nasopharyngeal swabs using MasSpec Pen-ESI mass spectrometry (MS) allow fast (under a minute) screening of the COVID-19 disease using minimal operating steps and no specialized reagents, thus representing a promising alternative high-throughput method for screening of COVID-19.</AbstractText></Abstract>",0,2021-09-23 00:00:00

This paper seeks to understand the relationship between exposure to biased media outlets and the likelihood of testing positive for COVID-19 in the USA. I use detailed household data extracted from the 2020 American National Election Study in order to gauge media consumption patterns, coupled with data on media bias scores for different outlets and programmes. I combine these variables to compute media bias exposure values for each respondent, and relate these to the likelihood of a positive COVID-19 test within each respondent's household, controlling for a variety of other factors including partisanship, social media use, trust in the media and several socioeconomic and demographic variables. The results indicate that media bias exposure is significantly related to COVID-19 incidence, and in particular the coefficients show that a 1% increase in exposure to left-wing media is associated with a 0.2% decrease in the probability of a positive COVID-19 test. Conversely, I find no significant relationship between right-wing media exposure and COVID-19 infection rates. I also find a significantly higher likelihood of contracting COVID-19 among low socioeconomic status households, suggesting a disproportionate impact of the pandemic on such cohorts. These findings are robust to a number of tests, and emphasise the importance of aligning media messages with those advocated by leading medical experts during public health crises.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

                <AbstractText>In this letter, we report the ability of the nanostructured aluminum Al 6063 alloy surfaces to inactivate the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). There was no recoverable viable virus after 6 h of exposure to the nanostructured surface, elucidating a 5-log reduction compared to a flat Al 6063 surface. The nanostructured surfaces were fabricated using wet-etching techniques which generated nanotextured, randomly aligned ridges approximately 23 nm wide on the Al 6063 alloy surfaces. In addition to the excellent mechanical resilience properties previously shown, the etched surfaces have also demonstrated superior corrosion resistance compared to the control surfaces. Such nanostructured surfaces have the potential to be used in healthcare environment such as hospitals and public spaces to reduce the surface transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and combat COVID-19.</AbstractText>

In 1989, Peplau published her thoughts on how World War II (WWII) shaped early PMH APN practice. Following WWII and the return of hundreds of thousands of previously mentally healthy service members with combat-related psychiatric symptoms and disorders, the prevailing societal beliefs about mental illness began to shift from an innate/inherited etiological perspective to a broader appreciation of the additional contributions of social and environmental factors to mental well-being. With that awareness came a decrease in stigma and a shift from housing patients in psychiatric hospitals to treating them in community settings. The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has likewise affected societal beliefs through exposure to the mental toll of massive infection rates, loss of life, social isolation, and other downstream consequences. During these times of crises, psychiatric nurses and educators are challenged to provide innovative solutions to meet the increased demands for psychosocial care.

                <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"">Characterising the size and distribution of the population at risk of severe COVID-19 is vital for effective policy and planning. Older age, and underlying health conditions, are associated with higher risk of death from COVID-19. This study aimed to describe the population at risk of severe COVID-19 due to underlying health conditions across the United Kingdom.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">We used anonymised electronic health records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD to estimate the point prevalence on 5 March 2019 of the at-risk population following national guidance. Prevalence for any risk condition and for each individual condition is given overall and stratified by age and region with binomial exact confidence intervals. We repeated the analysis on 5 March 2014 for full regional representation and to describe prevalence of underlying health conditions in pregnancy. We additionally described the population of cancer survivors, and assessed the value of linked secondary care records for ascertaining COVID-19 at-risk status.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">On 5 March 2019, 24.4% of the UK population were at risk due to a record of at least one underlying health condition, including 8.3% of school-aged children, 19.6% of working-aged adults, and 66.2% of individuals aged 70 years or more. 7.1% of the population had multimorbidity. The size of the at-risk population was stable over time comparing 2014 to 2019, despite increases in chronic liver disease and diabetes and decreases in chronic kidney disease and current asthma. Separately, 1.6% of the population had a new diagnosis of cancer in the past 5 y.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">The population at risk of severe COVID-19 (defined as either aged ≥70 years, or younger with an underlying health condition) comprises 18.5 million individuals in the UK, including a considerable proportion of school-aged and working-aged individuals. Our national estimates broadly support the use of Global Burden of Disease modelled estimates in other countries. We provide age- and region- stratified prevalence for each condition to support effective modelling of public health interventions and planning of vaccine resource allocation. The high prevalence of health conditions among older age groups suggests that age-targeted vaccination strategies may efficiently target individuals at higher risk of severe COVID-19.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>This paper describes three autopsy cases with postmortem diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with detailed macroscopic examination as well as advanced microscopic studies of organ tissues collected using hematoxylin-eosin stains and immunohistochemical markers. Two of the cases were admitted briefly in the County Clinical Emergency Hospital of Sibiu, and one was found deceased at his home address. All three autopsies were completed at the County morgue, in the COVID-19 restricted area, using complete protective equipment. The lungs of the patients seemed to be the center organ of invasion and pathogenesis of the novel coronavirus with diffuse areas of condensation, subpleural retraction zones but with different aspect of the classic bacterial bronchopneumonia. Microscopic evaluation revealed viral cytopathic effect of type II pneumocytes with a couple of cells that presented cytoplasmic and nuclear inclusions and who tend to form clusters mimicking multinucleated giant cells. Hyaline membranes and destruction of the alveolar wall as well as microthrombi formation within the small blood vessels were constantly found in almost all our three cases. The spleen had sustained white pulp atrophy with absence of lymphoid follicles. There were no microscopic signs of viral infection on the myocardium or the other organs.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>One of the many questions with respect to controlling the novel coronavirus pandemic is whether existing drugs can be re-purposed (re-positioned) for the prevention or treatment of Covid-19 - or for any future epidemic. The usefulness of existing approaches for re-purposing range from computational modeling to clinical trials. These are often time-consuming, resource intensive, and prone to failure. Proposed here is a new but simple concept that would capitalize on the opportunity presented by the on-going natural experiment involving the collection of data from epidemiological surveillance screening and diagnostic testing for clinical treatment. The objective would be to also collect for each Covid-19 case the patient's prior usage of existing therapeutic drugs. These drug usage data would be collected for several major test groups - those who test positive for active SARS-CoV-2 infection (using molecular methods) and those who test negative for current infection but also test positive for past infection (using serologic antibody tests). Patients from each of these groups would also be categorized with respect to where they resided on the spectrum of morbidities (from no or mild symptomology to severe). By comparing the distribution of normalized usage data for each drug within each group, drugs that are more associated with particular test groups could be revealed as having potential prophylactic, therapeutic, or contraindicated effects with respect to disease progression. These drugs could then be selected as candidates for further evaluation in fighting Covid-19. Also summarized are some of the numerous attributes, advantages, and limitations of the proposed concept, all pointing to the need for further discussion and evaluation.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has quickly spread worldwide and has affected more than 10 million individuals. A typical feature of COVID-19 is the suppression of type I and III interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral immunity. However, the molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 evades antiviral immunity remains elusive. Here, we reported that the SARS-CoV-2 membrane (M) protein inhibits the production of type I and III IFNs induced by the cytosolic dsRNA-sensing pathway mediated by RIG-I/MDA-5-MAVS signaling. In addition, the SARS-CoV-2 M protein suppresses type I and III IFN induction stimulated by SeV infection or poly (I:C) transfection. Mechanistically, the SARS-CoV-2 M protein interacts with RIG-I, MAVS, and TBK1, thus preventing the formation of the multiprotein complex containing RIG-I, MAVS, TRAF3, and TBK1 and subsequently impeding the phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and activation of IRF3. Consequently, ectopic expression of the SARS-CoV-2 M protein facilitates the replication of vesicular stomatitis virus. Taken together, these results indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 M protein antagonizes type I and III IFN production by targeting RIG-I/MDA-5 signaling, which subsequently attenuates antiviral immunity and enhances viral replication. This study provides insight into the interpretation of SARS-CoV-2-induced antiviral immune suppression and illuminates the pathogenic mechanism of COVID-19.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label=""OBJECTIVES"">Pulmonary platelet deposition and microangiopathy are increasingly recognized components of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Thrombosis is a known component of sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulation. We sought to compare the level of platelet deposition in the pulmonary vasculature in cases of confirmed COVID-19 infection to other lung injuries and infections.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">Immunohistochemistry was performed on 27 autopsy cases and 2 surgical pathology cases targeting CD61. Multiple cases of normal lung, diffuse alveolar damage, COVID-19, influenza, and bacterial and fungal infections, as well as one case of pulmonary emboli, were included. The levels of CD61 staining were compared quantitatively in the autopsy cases, and patterns of staining were described.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Nearly all specimens exhibited an increase in CD61 staining relative to control lung tissue. The area of CD61 staining in COVID-19 infection was higher than influenza but still comparable to many other infectious diseases. Cases of aspiration pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus infection, and blastomycosis exhibited the highest levels of CD61 staining.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Platelet deposition is a phenomenon common to many pulmonary insults. A spectrum of staining patterns was observed, suggestive of pathogen-specific mechanisms of platelet deposition. Further study into the mechanisms driving platelet deposition in pulmonary injuries and infections is warranted.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, many questions have come up regarding safe anesthesia management of patients with the disease. Regional anesthesia, whether peripheral nerve or neuraxial, is a safe alternative for managing patients with COVID-19, by choosing modalities that mitigate pulmonary function involvement. Adopting regional anesthesia mitigates adverse effects in the postoperative period and provides safety to pati ents and teams, as long as there is compliance with individual protection and interpersonal transmission care measures. Respecting contra-indications and judicial use of safety techniques and norms are essential. The present manuscript aims to review the evidence available on regional anesthesia for patients with COVID-19 and offer practical recommendations for safe and efficient performance.</AbstractText>

Autoimmune thyroid diseases are not linked to increased risks of COVID-19. Uncontrolled thyrotoxicosis may result in more severe complications from SARS-CoV-2 infection, including thyroid storm. The management of patients with a new diagnosis of hyperthyroidism is best undertaken with a block-and-replace regimen due to limited biochemical testing availability. Antithyroid drug (ATD)-induced neutropenia may favour the progression of COVID-19 and symptoms of infection may be confused with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The withdrawal of ATDs and urgent measurement of neutrophils should be considered in case of flu-like manifestations occurring in the initial months of treatment. Urgent surgery or 131-I may be undertaken in selected cases of uncontrolled thyrotoxicosis. Patients with COVID-19 infection may present with conjunctivitis, which could cause diagnostic difficulties in patients with new or existing Graves' ophthalmopathy. Patients who are on replacement treatment with thyroid hormones should ensure they have sufficient supply of medication. The usual advice to increase dosage of levothyroxine during pregnancy should be adhered to. Many newly presenting and previously diagnosed patients with thyroid dysfunction can be managed through virtual telephone or video clinics supported by a dedicated nurse-led service, depending on available facilities.</AbstractText>

However, no research has focused on the geodemographic classification of the most susceptible communities to COVID-19. In this cross-sectional ecological study, we used local fuzzy geographically-weighted clustering to create the socioeconomic profile of the US counties in relation to COVID-19 death rates. We demonstrate that living in a county which has households with lower income, people with a lack of health insurance, a high African-American percentage, and lower education level, lead to 27.12% higher COVID-19 death rates than the national median, and 72.56% higher compared to the least vulnerable counties. Compared to counties with a high COVID-19 death rate, counties with a low COVID-19 death rate have 44.90% higher annual median household income and nearly double house worth (89.51% more). Results show that the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are not universal and that the minoritised and impoverished populations suffer more. Our analysis can effectively pinpoint the most vulnerable counties and importantly allows for understanding the socioeconomic context in which tailored interventions can be applied to mitigate COVID-19 deaths.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>© 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Airborne MPs can be directly and continuously inhaled in air environments. Especially high MPs contributions can be found in indoor air due to the erosion and breakage of consumer, domestic and construction products, although there is little information available on their sources and concentrations and the risks they might pose. This is in part due to the fact that sampling and analysis of airborne MPs is a complex and multistep procedure where techniques used are not yet standardized.

                <AbstractText>There is an urgent and unprecedented need for sensitive and high-throughput molecular diagnostic tests to combat the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Here we present a generalized version of the RNA-mediated oligonucleotide Annealing Selection and Ligation with next generation DNA sequencing (RASL-seq) assay, called ""capture RASL-seq"" (cRASL-seq), which enables highly sensitive (down to ~1-100 pfu/ml or cfu/ml) and highly multiplexed (up to ~10,000 target sequences) detection of pathogens. Importantly, cRASL-seq analysis of COVID-19 patient nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens does not involve nucleic acid purification or reverse transcription, steps that have introduced supply bottlenecks into standard assay workflows. Our simplified protocol additionally enables the direct and efficient genotyping of selected, informative SARS-CoV-2 polymorphisms across the entire genome, which can be used for enhanced characterization of transmission chains at population scale and detection of viral clades with higher or lower virulence. Given its extremely low per-sample cost, simple and automatable protocol and analytics, probe panel modularity, and massive scalability, we propose that cRASL-seq testing is a powerful new technology with the potential to help mitigate the current pandemic and prevent similar public health crises.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a global pandemic in early 2020. Due to the rapid spread of the virus and limited availability of effective treatments, health and social care systems worldwide quickly became overwhelmed. Such stressful circumstances are likely to have negative impacts on health and social care workers' wellbeing. The current study examined the relationship between coping strategies and wellbeing and quality of working life in nurses, midwives, allied health professionals, social care workers and social workers who worked in health and social care in the UK during its first wave of COVID-19. Data were collected using an anonymous online survey (<i>N</i> = 3425), and regression analyses were used to examine the associations of coping strategies and demographic characteristics with staff wellbeing and quality of working life. The results showed that positive coping strategies, particularly active coping and help-seeking, were associated with higher wellbeing and better quality of working life. Negative coping strategies, such as avoidance, were risk factors for low wellbeing and worse quality of working life. The results point to the importance of organizational and management support during stressful times, which could include psycho-education and training about active coping and might take the form of workshops designed to equip staff with better coping skills.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic. The disease, typically characterized by bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and profound elevation of inflammatory markers, can range in severity from mild or asymptomatic illness to a lethal cytokine storm and respiratory failure. A number of recognized complications of COVID-19 infection are described in the literature. Common neurological complications include headache and anosmia. Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an uncommon complication described in isolated case reports. However, a causal relationship has yet to be established. This case report adds to the growing body of evidence that GBS is a potential COVID-19 complication.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to infect hundred thousands of people every day worldwide. Since it is a novel virus, research continues to update the possible therapeutic targets when new evidence regarding COVID-19 are gathered. This article presents an evidence-based hypothesis that activating the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathway is a potential target for COVID-19. Interferons (IFNs) have broad-spectrum antiviral activity including against SARS-CoV-2. Induction of HO-1 and increase in the heme catabolism end-product confer antiviral activity. IFN activation results in inhibition of viral replication in various viral infections. COVID-19 induced inflammation as well as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and coagulopathies are now known major causes of mortality. A protective role of HO-1 induction in inflammation, inflammation-induced coagulation, and ARDS has been reported. Based on an association of HO-1 promoter polymorphisms and disease severity, we propose an evaluation of the status of these polymorphisms in COVID-19 patients who become severely ill. If an association is established, it might be helpful in identifying patients at high risk. Hence, we hypothesize that HO-1 pathway activation could be a therapeutic strategy against COVID-19 and associated complications.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Viral infections and associated diseases are responsible for a substantial number of mortality and public health problems around the world. Each year, infectious diseases kill 3.5 million people worldwide. The current pandemic caused by COVID-19 has become the greatest health hazard to people in their lifetime. There are many antiviral drugs and vaccines available against viruses, but they have many disadvantages, too. There are numerous side effects for conventional drugs, and active mutation also creates drug resistance against various viruses. This has led scientists to search herbs as a source for the discovery of more efficient new antivirals. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 65% of the world population is in the practice of using plants and herbs as part of treatment modality. Additionally, plants have an advantage in drug discovery based on their long-term use by humans, and a reduced toxicity and abundance of bioactive compounds can be expected as a result. In this review, we have highlighted the important viruses, their drug targets, and their replication cycle. We provide in-depth and insightful information about the most favorable plant extracts and their derived phytochemicals against viral targets. Our major conclusion is that plant extracts and their isolated pure compounds are essential sources for the current viral infections and useful for future challenges.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>The COVID-19 pandemic has shuttered many university research labs because campuses are closed, and faculty and students lack productive ways of working remotely. This presents major difficulties for students who need research opportunities to fulfill their intellectual growth potential and their undergraduate research and thesis requirements. Without research experiences, undergraduates may be less competitive for future jobs and graduate programs. Similarly, faculty need research avenues to advance their academic careers while maintaining physically distant protocols. We outline here a budget-friendly, COVID-friendly, adaptable protocol that aims to introduce students to the wildlife research opportunities surrounding their campus or home through observation and literature research. Student researchers learn the scientific method by getting first-hand experience with an original research project. The pedagogical goals include designing a study: defining a question or proposing a hypothesis, collecting, organizing, and analyzing data, and sharing results in the form of posters, theses, informal educational materials, and scientific publications. This protocol is flexible to allow for different budgets, opportunities, and constraints. The researchers monitor different locations using trail cameras to determine which species are present around campus or even students' homes. During the COVID-19 pandemic, when it is likely there will be few in-person meetings, this protocol offers students the opportunity to carry out research with limited or no in-person meetings, and it can be run remotely by sharing the data collected. In this paper, we provide instructions, details, and student handouts for instructors to help implement this research project.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText><i>Background and Objectives</i>: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, patients with chronic diseases suffering exacerbations have required acute medical care. The purpose of our study was to determine useful criteria for the differentiation of patients with acute clinical syndromes and suspicion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: This was an observational retrospective study, conducted in an internal medicine clinic from April to May 2020. We collected clinical, biological, and computed tomography (CT) data on patients with exacerbations of chronic diseases and clinical suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients with an already-positive real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 on presentation at the emergency department were excluded from our study. <i>Results</i>: Of 253 suspected cases, 20 were laboratory-confirmed as having SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR, whereas COVID-19 diagnosis was ruled out in the remaining 233. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) correlated significantly with COVID-19 diagnosis in suspected patients, while laboratory markers were not significantly different between the two groups. Of the suspected patients, significantly higher percentages of dry cough, fever, myalgias, sore throat, loss of smell and appetite, and ground-glass opacities (GGOs) on CT were found in SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals. <i>Conclusions</i>: The study demonstrated that, until receiving the result of an RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 (usually 12-24 h), association with VTE as a comorbidity, fever, dry cough, and myalgia as clinical features, and GGO on CT are the main markers for the identification of COVID-19 patients among those suspected with acute clinical syndromes. Our results also provide evidence for doctors not to rely solely on biological markers in the case of suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with exacerbations of chronic diseases. These data are useful for faster decision-making with regard to suspected COVID-19 patients before receiving RT-PCR test results, thus avoiding keeping patients in crowded emergency departments.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label=""OBJECTIVES"">The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has presented clinicians with a difficult therapeutic dilemma. With supportive care as the current mainstay of treatment, the fatality rate of COVID-19 is 6.9%. There are currently several trials assessing the efficacy of different antivirals as treatment. Of these, chloroquine (CQ) and its derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have garnered the most attention.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">In this study, the literature currently available on CQ and HCQ as treatment of COVID-19 was surveyed using EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, MedRxiv, and one clinical trial registry. Upon gathering published and preprint trials, risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2.0.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">There are currently seven completed clinical trials and 29 registered clinical trials focusing on HCQ or CQ as a therapeutic avenue for COVID-19. Of these, five of seven trials have shown favorable outcomes for patients using CQ or HCQ and two of seven have shown no change compared to control. However, all seven trials carried varying degrees of bias and poor study design.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">There are currently not enough data available to support the routine use of HCQ and CQ as therapies for COVID-19. Pending further results from more extensive studies with more stringent study parameters, clinicians should defer from routine use of HCQ and CQ. There are several clinical trials currently under way with results expected soon.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>The rapid evolution of the health emergency linked to the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 requires specifications for the rehabilitative management of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The symptomatic evolution of patients with COVID-19 is characterized by 2 phases: an acute phase in which respiratory symptoms prevail and a postacute phase in which patients can show symptoms related to prolonged immobilization, to previous and current respiratory dysfunctions, and to cognitive and emotional disorders. Thus, there is the need for specialized rehabilitative care for these patients. This communication reports the experience of the San Raffaele Hospital of Milan and recommends the setup of specialized clinical pathways for the rehabilitation of patients with COVID-19. In this hospital, between February 1 and March 2, 2020, about 50 patients were admitted every day with COVID-19 symptoms. In those days, about 400 acute care beds were created (intensive care/infectious diseases). In the following 30 days, from March 2 to mid-April, despite the presence of 60 daily arrivals to the emergency department, the organization of patient flow between different wards was modified, and several different units were created based on a more accurate integration of patients' needs. According to this new organization, patients were admitted first to acute care COVID-19 units and then to COVID-19 rehabilitation units, post-COVID-19 rehabilitation units, and/or quarantine/observation units. After hospital discharge, telemedicine was used to follow-up with patients at home. Such clinical pathways should each involve dedicated multidisciplinary teams composed of pulmonologists, physiatrists, neurologists, cardiologists, physiotherapists, neuropsychologists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, and nutritionists.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Pooling of samples can increase lab capacity when using Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect diseases such as COVID-19. However, pool testing is typically performed via an adaptive testing strategy which requires a feedback loop in the lab and at least two PCR runs to confirm positive results. This can cost precious time. We discuss a non-adaptive testing method where each sample is distributed in a prescribed manner over several pools, and which yields reliable results after one round of testing. More precisely, assuming knowledge about the overall incidence rate, we calculate explicit error bounds on the number of false positives which scale favourably with pool size and sample multiplicity. This allows for hugely streamlined PCR testing and cuts in detection times for a large-scale testing scenario. A viable consequence of this method could be real-time screening of entire communities, frontline healthcare workers and international flight passengers, for example, using the PCR machines currently in operation.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Due to the multi-potential differentiation and immunomodulatory function, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been widely used in the therapy of chronic and autoimmune diseases. Recently, the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has grown to be a global public health emergency but no effective drug is available to date. Several studies investigated MSCs therapy for COVID-19 patients. However, it remains unclear whether MSCs could be the host cells of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2) and whether they might affect the SARS-CoV-2 entry into other cells. Here, we report that human MSCs barely express ACE2 and TMPRSS2, two receptors required for the virus endocytosis, indicating that MSCs are free from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, we observed that MSCs were unable to induce the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in epithelial cells and macrophages. Importantly, under different inflammatory challenge conditions, implanted human MSCs failed to up-regulate the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the lung tissues of mice. Intriguingly, we showed that a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus failed to infect MSCs and co-cultured MSCs did not increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection in epithelial cells. All these results suggest that human MSCs have no risk of assisting SARS-CoV-2 infection and the use of MSCs as the therapy for COVID-19 patients is feasible and safe.</AbstractText>

A total of 860 self-selected participants residing in the Western Cape province completed an online survey from 20-31 May 2020. This sample consisted mainly of higher socioeconomic and higher educated segments of the population. Structural equation modelling was used to assess how sociodemographic factors, membership of vulnerable groups and COVID-19 related stressors were associated with PHQ-9 (depression) and GAD-7 (anxiety) scores. 46.0% and 47.2% of participants met the diagnostic threshold of anxiety and depressive disorder, respectively. Considerable daily life repercussions were linked to these scores. Among these participants, less than 20% consulted a formal practitioner and this was 12% for participants without a pre-existing mental health condition. Distress related to containment measures and distress about being infected were significantly associated with more anxiety and depressive symptoms. Having a pre-existing mental health condition was associated with poorer mental health, but being an active health worker was not. Younger age, being female, and living in a non-rural area were associated with poorer mental health. Our findings suggest a considerable mental health impact of this pandemic and related containment measures, but low attendance of mental health services. The accessibility to tailored mental health support is essential under these circumstances, especially for vulnerable groups.</AbstractText></Abstract>",0,2021-07-28 00:00:00

We examined differences between those providing data pre- and post-university closure via linear and negative binomial regressions. Alcohol and cannabis use days were 13 % and 24 % higher, respectively, from pre-to post-university closure; also, prevalence of any 30-day alcohol use and alcohol use consequences were both higher in the post-closure sample (odds ratios = 1.34 and 1.31, respectively). In contrast, days of binge alcohol use were 4 % lower in the post-closing sample. Depressive symptoms and anger were both modestly higher in post-closing participants (d &lt; 0.1), with no differences in anxiety symptoms or insomnia.

                <AbstractText>COVID-19 is a global pandemic associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Convalescent plasma (CP) infusion is a strategy of potential therapeutic benefit. We conducted a multicenter phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CP in patients with COVID-19, grade 4 or higher. To evaluate the efficacy of CP, a matched propensity score analysis was used comparing the intervention (<i>n</i> = 59) to a control group (<i>n</i> = 59). Sixty patients received CP within a median time of 7 days from symptom onset. During a median follow-up of 28.5 days, 56/60 patients fully recovered and 1 patient remained in the ICU. The death rate in the CP group was 3.4% vs. 13.6% in the control group. By multivariate analysis, CP recipients demonstrated a significantly reduced risk of death [HR: 0.04 (95% CI: 0.004-0.36), <i>p</i>: 0.005], significantly better overall survival by Kaplan-Meir analysis (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and increased probability of extubation [OR: 30.3 (95% CI: 2.64-348.9), <i>p</i>: 0.006]. Higher levels of antibodies in the CP were independently associated with significantly reduced risk of death. CP infusion was safe with only one grade 3 adverse event (AE), which easily resolved. CP used early may be a safe and effective treatment for patients with severe COVID-19 (trial number NCT04408209).</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"">So far, there have been no published population studies on the relationship between a COVID-19 infection and public risk perception, information source, knowledge, attitude, and behaviors during the COVID-19 outbreak in China.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""OBJECTIVE"">This study aims to understand the relationships between COVID-19 infection; four personal nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs; handwashing, proper coughing habits, social distancing, and mask wearing); and public risk perception, knowledge, attitude, and other social demographic variables.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">An online survey of 8158 Chinese adults between February 22 and March 5, 2020, was conducted. Bivariate associations between categorical variables were examined using Fisher exact test. We also explored the determinants of four NPIs as well as their association with COVID-19 infection using logistic regression.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Of 8158 adults included, 57 (0.73%) were infected with COVID-19. The overwhelming majority of respondents showed a positive attitude (n=8094, 99.2%), positive risk perception (n=8146, 99.9%), and high knowledge levels that were among the strongest predictors of the four adopted NPIs (handwashing: n=7895, 96.8%; proper coughing: 5997/6444, 93.1%; social distancing: n=7104/8158, 87.1%; and mask wearing: 5011/5120, 97.9%). There was an increased risk of COVID-19 infection for those who did not wash their hands (2.28% vs 0.65%; risk ratio [RR] 3.53, 95% CI 1.53-8.15; P=.009), did not practice proper coughing (1.79% vs 0.73%; RR 2.44, 95% CI 1.15-5.15; P=.03), did not practice social distancing (1.52% vs 0.58%; RR 2.63, 95% CI 1.48-4.67; P=.002), and did not wear a mask (7.41% vs 0.6%; RR 12.38, 95% CI 5.81-26.36; P&lt;.001). For those who did practice all other three NPIs, wearing a mask was associated with a significantly reduced risk of infection compared to those who did not wear a mask (0.6% vs 16.7%; P=.04). Similarly, for those who did not practice all or part of the other three NPIs, wearing a mask was also associated with a significantly reduced risk of infection. In a penalized logistic regression model including all four NPIs, wearing a mask was the only significant predictor of COVID-19 infection among the four NPIs (odds ratio 7.20, 95% CI 2.24-23.11; P&lt;.001).</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">We found high levels of risk perception, positive attitude, desirable knowledge, as well as a high level of adopting the four NPIs. The relevant knowledge, risk perception, and attitude were strong predictors of adapting the four NPIs. Mask wearing, among the four personal NPIs, was the most effective protective measure against COVID-19 infection, with added preventive effect among those who practiced all or part of the other three NPIs.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Pandemics, like other global challenges, are unquestionably curricular issues. They are curriculum issues not only because of the disrupting consequences of Covid-19 and the economic and social crisis alike but also because people have, through their own activities, contributed to global catastrophes and perpetuated injustices. This article attempts to answer the question: How does Finnish curricular thought, including the role of the teacher and the core curriculum for basic education, respond to the various global crises? While reviewing the current situation, the article also imagines a post-Covid-19 curriculum. Reactivating what is still powerful in <i>Bildung/Didaktik</i> and emphasizing the importance of education's ethical dimension and the teacher's role as a curriculum theorist offer the means for dealing with the theme. In addition, understanding the structure of the National Core Curriculum document, the political dimension of the Finnish curriculum's design process, and the educative possibilities in subjects and multidisciplinary modules, the teacher is capable of creating opportunities for educational experiences that are (ethically) significant for students, proactively and in terms of crises.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>International emergency management and disaster risk reduction policies and planning have rarely included lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, and queer (LGBTIQ) people's specific health and wellbeing concerns, despite increasing research showing that these groups face some specific vulnerabilities and additional challenges. Emerging studies in the US and UK noted increased feelings of loneliness, minority stress, and vulnerability to family violence since the outbreak of COVID-19. However, little is known about LGBTIQ people's experiences of COVID-19 in Australia. This article explores the effects of COVID-19 on LGBTIQ mental health and wellbeing in Tasmania, Australia. Drawing on a survey of 231 LGBTIQ respondents aged 14-78, we use the spaces of wellbeing framework to examine the impacts of COVID-19 restrictions on LGBTIQ (in)visibility in relation to the public, private, and online spaces, arguing that COVID-19 restrictions affected LGBTIQ Tasmanians' experiences and use of spaces in ways that detracted from wellbeing, visibility, and belonging.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a serious public health concern, with an exponentially growing number of patients worldwide. Computed tomography (CT) has been suggested as a highly sensitive modality for the diagnosis of pulmonary involvement in the early stages of COVID-19. The typical features of COVID-19 in chest CT include bilateral, peripheral, and multifocal ground-glass opacities with or without superimposed consolidations. Patients with underlying medical conditions are at higher risks of complications and mortality. The diagnosis of COVID-19 on the basis of the imaging features may be more challenging in patients with preexisting cardiothoracic conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, cardiovascular disease, and malignancies with cardiothoracic involvement. The extensive pulmonary involvement in some of these pathologies may obscure the typical manifestation of COVID-19, whereas other preexisting pathologies may resemble the atypical or rare CT manifestations of this viral pneumonia. Thus, understanding the specific CT manifestations in these special subgroups is essential for a prompt diagnosis.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>COVID-19 has spread globally, infecting and killing millions of people worldwide. The use of operating rooms (ORs) and the post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) for intensive care is part of surge response planning. We aim to describe and discuss some of the practical considerations involved in a large tertiary hospital in Singapore. Firstly, considerations for setting up a level III intensive care unit (ICU) include that of space, staff, supplies and standards. Secondly, oxygen supply of the entire hospital is a major determinant of the number of ventilators it can support, including those on non-invasive forms of oxygen therapy. Thirdly, air flows due to positive pressure systems within the OR complex need to be addressed. In addition, due to the worldwide shortage of ICU ventilators, the US Food and Drug Administration has granted temporary approval for the use of anaesthesia gas machines for patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Lastly, planning of logistics and staff deployment needs to be carefully considered during a crisis. Although OR and PACU are not designed for long-term care of critically ill patients, they may be adapted for ICU use with careful planning in the current pandemic.</AbstractText>

Social distancing has changed the way people behave online, and we expect that engagement in sexting and online sexual victimization behaviors have increased during lockdown. The aim of this paper is to study the prevalence of sexting and online sexual victimization behaviors during the COVID-19 lockdown in Spanish adults in order to explore how social distancing has affected these behaviors. The sample comprised 293 Spanish adults (mean age = 30.3; 66.2% female) who took part in an online survey about their engagement in sexting behaviors and online sexual victimization experiences. Overall results were apparently not supportive of our main hypothesis, showing that both sexting engagement and online sexual victimization decreased during lockdown despite the increase in internet use. Apart from differences in time period of reference, some alternative hypotheses relate to the increased presence of capable guardians according to the routine activities theory and to forced distance as a demotivation to sext. Possible explanations and hypotheses for these results are discussed further in the paper.</AbstractText></Abstract>",0,2021-07-24 00:00:00

                <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"">The burden of population aging and chronic conditions has been reported worldwide. Older adults, especially those with high needs, experience social isolation and have high rates of emergency visits and limited satisfaction with the care they receive. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies present opportunities to address these challenges. To date, limited information is available on Canadian older adults' attitudes toward and use of mHealth technologies for self-tracking purposes-an area that is increasingly important and relevant during the COVID-19 era.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""OBJECTIVE"">This study presents contributions to an underresearched area on older adults and mHealth technology use. The aim of this study was to compare older adults' use of mHealth technologies to that of the general adult population in Canada and to investigate the factors that affect their use.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">A cross-sectional survey on mHealth and digital self-tracking was conducted. A web-based questionnaire was administered to a national sample of 4109 Canadian residents who spoke either English or French. The survey instrument consisted of 3 sections assessing the following items: (1) demographic characteristics, health status, and comorbidities; (2) familiarity with and use of mHealth technologies (ie, mobile apps, consumer smart devices/wearables such as vital signs monitors, bathroom scales, fitness trackers, intelligent clothing); and (3) factors influencing the continued use of mHealth technologies.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Significant differences were observed between the older adults and the general adult population in the use of smart technologies and internet (P&lt;.001). Approximately 47.4% (323/682) of the older adults in the community reported using smartphones and 49.8% (340/682) indicated using digital tablets. Only 19.6% (91/463) of the older adults using smartphones/digital tablets reported downloading mobile apps, and 12.3% (47/383) of the older adults who heard of smart devices/wearables indicated using them. The majority of the mobile apps downloaded by older adults was health-related; interestingly, their use was sustained over a longer period of time (P=.007) by the older adults compared to that by the general population. Approximately 62.7% (428/682) of the older adults reported tracking their health measures, but the majority did so manually. Older adults with one or more chronic conditions were mostly nontrackers (odds ratio 0.439 and 0.431 for traditional trackers and digital trackers, respectively). No significant differences were observed between the older adults and the general adult population with regard to satisfaction with mHealth technologies and their intention to continue using them.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Leveraging mHealth technologies in partnership with health care providers and sharing of health/well-being data with health care professionals and family members remain very limited. A culture shift in the provision of care to older adults is deemed necessary to keep up with the development of mHealth technologies and the changing demographics and expectations of patients and their caregivers.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>COVID-19 is an ongoing pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus with important political, socio-economic, and public health consequences. Inhibiting replication represents an important antiviral approach, and in this context two viral proteases, the SARS-CoV-2 main and papain-like proteases (PL<sup>pro</sup>), which cleave pp1a and pp1ab polypeptides, are critical. Along with protease activity, the PL<sup>pro</sup> possesses deubiquitinating activity, which is important in immune regulation. Naphthalene-based inhibitors, such as the well-investigated GRL-0617 compound, have been shown to possess dual effects, inhibiting both protease and deubiquitinating activity of the PL<sup>pro</sup>. Rather than binding to the canonical catalytic triad, these type of non-covalent inhibitors target an adjacent pocket, the naphthalene-inhibitor binding site. Using a high-throughput screen, we have previously identified the dietary hypericin, rutin, and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside compounds as potential protease inhibitors targeting the naphthalene-inhibitor binding site. Here, our aim was to investigate the binding characteristics of these compounds to the PL<sup>pro</sup>, and to evaluate deubiquitinating activity, by analyzing seven different PL<sup>pro</sup> crystal structures. Molecular docking highlighted the relatively high affinity of GRL-0617 and dietary compounds. In contrast binding of the small molecules was abolished in the presence of ubiquitin in the palm subdomain of the PL<sup>pro</sup>. Further, docking the small molecules in the naphthalene-inhibitor binding site, followed by protein-protein docking revealed displacement of ubiquitin in a conformation inconsistent with functional activity. Finally, the deubiquitinating activity was validated <i>in vitro</i> using an enzymatic activity assay. The findings indicated that the dietary compounds inhibited deubiquitinase activity in the micromolar range with an order of activity of GRL-0167, hypericin &gt; rutin, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside &gt; epigallocatechin gallate, epicatechin gallate, and cefotaxime. Our findings are in accordance with mechanisms and potential antiviral effects of the naphthalene-based, GRL-0617 inhibitor, which is currently progressing in preclinical trials. Further, our findings indicate that in particular hypericin, rutin, and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, represent suitable candidates for subsequent evaluation as PL<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors.</AbstractText>

Specifically, that interdisciplinary team is working alongside acute and primary care personnel, as well as public health leaders to deliver 'situated interventions' that flow from studying communications, interpretations and implementations across responding organisations. Acting in real time, the team is providing critical insights on policy communication and implementation to targeted members of the health system. Using our rapid and ongoing deployment as a case study of social science techniques applied to a pandemic, we describe how other health systems might leverage social science to improve their preparations and communications.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label=""Objective"">To examine the outcomes of a cancer center-wide virtual care program in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""Design, Setting, and Participants"">This cohort study applied a hospitalwide agile service design to map gaps and develop a customized digital solution to enable at-scale VC across a publicly funded comprehensive cancer center. Data were collected from a high-volume cancer center in Ontario, Canada, from March 23 to May 22, 2020.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""Main Outcomes and Measures"">Outcome measures were care delivery volumes, quality of care, patient and practitioner experiences, and cost savings to patients.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""Results"">The VC solution was developed and launched 12 days after the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 22 085 VC visits (mean, 514 visits per day) were conducted, comprising 68.4% (range, 18.8%-100%) of daily visits compared with 0.8% before launch (P &lt; .001). Ambulatory clinic volumes recovered a month after deployment (3714-4091 patients per week), whereas chemotherapy and radiotherapy caseloads (1943-2461 patients per week) remained stable throughout. No changes in institutional or provincial quality-of-care indexes were observed. A total of 3791 surveys (3507 patients and 284 practitioners) were completed; 2207 patients (82%) and 92 practitioners (72%) indicated overall satisfaction with VC. The direct cost of this initiative was CAD$ 202 537, and displacement-related cost savings to patients totaled CAD$ 3 155 946.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""Conclusions and Relevance"">These findings suggest that implementation of VC at scale at a high-volume cancer center may be feasible. An agile service design approach was able to preserve outpatient caseloads and maintain care quality, while rendering high patient and practitioner satisfaction. These findings may help guide the transformation of telemedicine in the post COVID-19 era.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>This article examines the relation between counting, counts and accountability. It does so by comparing the responses of the British government to deaths associated with Covid-19 in 2020 to its responses to deaths associated with the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Similarities and dissimilarities between the cases regarding what counted as data, what data were taken to count, what data counted for, and how data were counted provide the basis for considering how the bounds of democratic accountability are constituted. Based on these two cases, the article sets out the metaphors of leaks and cascades as ways of characterising the data practices whereby counts, counting and accountability get configured. By situating deaths associated with Covid-19 against previous experience with deaths from war, the article also proposes how claims to truth and ignorance might figure in any future official inquiry into the handling of the pandemic.</AbstractText>

Previously, the human defensin 5 (HD5) has been experimentally confirmed to be functional against the SARS-CoV-2. The present study proposes a human cathelicidin known as LL37 that strongly binds to the carboxypeptidase domain of human ACE2 compared to HD5. Therefore, LL37 bears a great potential to be tested as an anti-SARS-CoVD-2 peptide. We investigated the molecular interactions formed between the LL37 and ACE2 as well as HD5 and ACE2 tailed by their thermodynamic stability.

                <AbstractText>The emerging and underdeveloped countries in Africa face numerous difficulties managing infectious waste during the SARS-CoV-2 disease, known as the COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, the main aim of this paper is to help decision-makers in African countries to select the best available waste management strategy during the COVID-19 pandemic. The present research undertakes seamless assessment and prioritization of infectious solid waste (SW) and wastewater (WW) treatment technologies based on a criteria system involving four dimensions, i.e., environment-safety, technology, economics, and sociopolitics. A combined approach that integrates the results of life-cycle assessments and life-cycle costs (LCA-LCC), analytic hierarchy process (AHP), and VIKOR method in an interval-valued fuzzy (IVF) environment is proposed. The results reveal that combined incineration and chemical disinfection approach, and combined chlorination and ultraviolet irradiation are the most sustainable technologies for managing infectious SW and WW treatment in the present context. The proposed approach, alongside the findings of the study, constitutes a reference to devise urgent planning for contagious waste management in African countries as well as developing countries worldwide.</AbstractText>

Likewise, educational backgrounds ranged broadly, from high school completion to Master's degrees. Two of the participants were unemployed, having recently lost their jobs because of the pandemic. The thematic analysis resulted in five major themes: perceived benefits, patterns of use, privacy, social influence, and need for collective action. Benefits of using the app to society in general were more salient to the participants than immediate health benefits to the individual. Use, however, depended on alert level, and tended to decline for many participants at low alert levels. Privacy considerations played little role in shaping adoption and use, even though the participants were highly aware of privacy discourse around the app. Participants were aware of the need for high levels of adoption and use of the app to control the pandemic. Attempts to encourage others to use the app were common, although not always successful.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Appeals to civic responsibility are likely to drive the use of a mobile contact tracing app under the conditions of high threat. Under the likely scenario of COVID-19 remaining endemic and requiring on-going vigilance over the long term, other mechanisms promoting the use of mobile contact tracing apps may be needed, such as offering incentives. As privacy is not an important concern for many users, flexible privacy settings in mobile contact tracing apps allowing users to set their optimal levels of privacy may be appropriate.</AbstractText></Abstract>",0,2021-07-22 00:00:00

                <AbstractText>The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly become a global health crisis, leading people to change their interpersonal behaviours to contain the spread of the virus. Italy has rapidly become the country hit second hardest in the world by the COVID-19 pandemic and the first one in Western countries. To reduce the spread of the COVID-19, people are required to change their interpersonal behaviours, reducing their social interactions in close contacts. The lockdown impact on the economy as well as on social and psychological processes is relevant, we conducted an exploratory study to examine which social factors are associated with the psychological reactions of Italians during the COVID-19 lockdown. Participants (<i>n</i> = 690) self-reported their social identification on three levels (i.e., Italians, Europeans and humankind), their trust toward social and political actors, and their level of welbeing, interdependent-happiness, and distress. Results showed that the relation between trust and the level of wellbeing and distress was mediated by identification with Italians and humankind, only the identification with humankind mediated the relationship between trust and the level of interdependent-happiness. The identification with Europeans did not emerge as a mediator in such relationships. The implications for dealing with COVID-19 lockdown in Italy are discussed.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>This article aims to discuss the meaning of the coronavirus crisis as an integral part of the totality of the capitalist crisis and its implication in the health area of Brazilian capitalism, in which the rise of ultraliberal and neofascist policies is witnessed by the Bolsonaro government. To this end, we opted for a historical-dialectical materialist analysis of the situation experienced between the global beginning of the pandemic until the month of May 2020 in Brazil. The article is structured in 2 parts: The first discusses the problem of agrifood systems in the context of capitalism in crisis and its effects on the spread of diseases such as the coronavirus, and the second discusses the neglect of the Bolsonaro government in facing the COVID-19 pandemic and the Brazilian universal health system. Evidence shows that the Bolsonaro government has led to more deaths and more of the barbarism of capitalism. The scenario after the pandemic will be one of a country with a more or less intense capitalist crisis depending on the resistance of workers in the defense of public health and lives.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Parental and familial factors influence numerous aspects of adolescents' lives, including their physical activity level (PAL). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the changes in PAL which occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to evaluate influence of sociodemographic and parental/familial factors on PAL levels before and during pandemic in adolescents from Bosnia and Herzegovina. The sample included 688 adolescents (15-18 years of age; 322 females) who were tested on two occasions: in January 2020 (baseline; before the COVID-19 pandemic) and in April 2020 (follow-up; during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown). Variables included PAL (measured by the Physical Activity Questionnaire for Adolescents-PAQ-A) as well as sociodemographic-, parental-, and familial factors. A significant decline in PALs was recorded between baseline and follow-up (<i>t</i>-test: 11.88, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Approximately 50% of adolescents underwent sufficient PAL at baseline, while only 24% of them were achieving sufficient PAL at the time of follow-up measurement. Paternal education was positively correlated (OR (95%CI): baseline: 6.63 (4.58-9.96), follow-up: 3.33 (1.19-7.01)), while familial conflict was negatively correlated (baseline: 0.72 (0.57-0.90), follow-up: 0.77 (0.60-0.99)) with PALs before and during the pandemic. This study highlights the importance of the parent-child relationship and parental/familiar support in promoting physical activity both during regular life and during crises and health challenging situations like the COVID-19 pandemic.</AbstractText>

These narratives create complexities as they collide with the authors' everyday lives as nurses, educators, and women. This collision creates three paradoxes for us: (a) learning to care by creating physical distance, (b) a sense of togetherness erases inequities, and (c) returning to normal is possible. To inquire into these three paradoxes, we draw on our experiences with Ingrid, an older adult who requires in-home physical care, and Matthew, a man with multiple disabilities including severe oral dyspraxia and developmental delays. We outline how narrative care is a counterstory to the dominant narratives and enables us to find ways to live our lives within the paradoxes. Narrative care allows us, through attention to embodiment, liminality, and imagination, to create forward looking stories. Understanding narrative care within these paradoxes allows us to offer more complex understandings of the ways narrative care can be embodied in our, and others', lives.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>© 2021 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>",0,2021-09-20 00:00:00

                <AbstractText>A global pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) resulted in restrictions to daily living for Canadians, including social distancing and closure of city and provincial recreation facilities, national parks and playgrounds. The objective of this study was to assess how these preemptive measures impacted physical activity behaviour and well-being of Canadians. An online survey was utilized to measure participant physical activity behavior, nature exposure, well-being and anxiety levels. Results indicate that while 40.5% of inactive individuals became less active, only 22.4% of active individuals became less active. Comparatively, 33% of inactive individuals became more active while 40.3% of active individuals became more active. There were significant differences in well-being outcomes in the inactive population between those who were more active, the same or less active (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) but this was not seen in the active population. Inactive participants who spent more time engaged in outdoor physical activity had lower anxiety than those who spent less time in outdoor physical activity. Public health measures differentially affected Canadians who were active and inactive and physical activity was strongly associated with well-being outcomes in inactive individuals. This suggests that health promoting measures directed towards inactive individuals may be essential to improving well-being.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label=""Methods"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">Participants were 119 older adults (69 males, 50 females; average age 77.3 ± 8.3 years) requiring long-term care who used outpatient rehabilitation services. Our outpatient rehabilitation service involved day care for older adults undergoing rehabilitation including pick-up and drop-off services under the long-term care insurance system. They were divided into two groups: participants who discontinued using outpatient rehabilitation services and participants who continued their use. To find the factors associated with this discontinuation, binomial logistic regression analysis was performed, in which the following independent variables were used: gender, age, height, weight, long-term care level, grip strength, and normal walking speed.

Higher levels of bacterial infection indices (eg, white blood cell count, neutrophil count, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin) were observed in the elevated group. Spearman correlation showed that both ALT and AST levels were positively correlated with those indices of bacterial infection. No obvious effects of medications on ALT abnormalities were found. In patients with elevated ALT, most ALT elevations were mild and transient. 59.4% of the patients had ALT concentrations of 41-100 U/L, while only a few patients (5.2%) had high serum ALT concentrations above 300 U/L. ALT elevations occurred at 13 (10-17) days and recovered at 28 (18-35) days from disease onset.

Many patients are required to travel long distances to access specialist care. The COVID-19 pandemic brought a number of rapid changes into the care for patients with cancer, with increasing utilization of telemedicine. We aimed to evaluate how the utilization of telemedicine affects professionals and patients across Scotland and care delivery, at the Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre Sarcoma Unit.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">Between June 8 and August 25, 2020, we invited patients and professional sarcoma multidisciplinary team members to participate in separate online anonymous survey questionnaires, to assess their attitudes toward telemedicine.

Patients were receptive to the use of telemedicine in certain situations, with patients strongly opposed to being told bad news via telemedicine (88%). Providers recommended the use of telemedicine in certain patient populations and reported largely equivalent workloads when compared with traditional consultations. Providers reported that telemedicine should be integrated into regular practice (66%), with patients echoing this indicating a preference for a majority of telemedicine appointments (57%).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">Telemedicine in sarcoma care is favorable from both clinician and patient perspectives. Utilization of telemedicine for patients with rare cancers such as sarcomas is an innovative approach to the delivery of care, especially considering the time and financial pressures on patients who often live a distance away from specialist centers.

Of the remaining 48 patients, lung involvement was bilateral in 32 (67%). Right upper lobe in 26 (54%), right middle lobe in 20 (42%), right lower lobe in 38 (79%), left upper lobe in 27 (56%), and left lower lobe were affected in 34 (71%) patients. The mean number of opacities detected in patients was 7.5 ± 5.7. The opacities were located only peripherally/subpleural in 22 (46%), only centrally/peribronchovascular in 5 (10%), and mixed in 21 (44%) patients. The frequency of pure ground glass opacities (GGO) was 63% GGO with a crazy-paving pattern or consolidation was 33%. Pure consolidation was detected in only two (4%) patients. Parenchymal opacities were only round in 27 (56%), only geographic demarcated in 3 (6%), only patchy in 2 (4%), and mixed in 16 (33%) patients.</AbstractText>

To date, delivery platforms for saRNA have included lipid nanoparticles (LNP), polyplexes and cationic nanoemulsions; of these LNP are the most clinically advanced with the recent FDA approval of COVID-19 based-modified mRNA vaccines. While the effect of RNA on vaccine immunogenicity is well studied, the role of biomaterials in saRNA vaccine effectiveness is under investigated. Here, we tested saRNA formulated with either pABOL, a bioreducible polymer, or LNP, and characterized the protein expression and vaccine immunogenicity of both platforms. We observed that pABOL-formulated saRNA resulted in a higher magnitude of protein expression, but that the LNP formulations were overall more immunogenic. Furthermore, we observed that both the helper phospholipid and route of administration (intramuscular versus intranasal) of LNP impacted the vaccine immunogenicity of two model antigens (influenza hemagglutinin and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein). We observed that LNP administered intramuscularly, but not pABOL or LNP administered intranasally, resulted in increased acute interleukin-6 expression after vaccination. Overall, these results indicate that delivery systems and routes of administration may fulfill different delivery niches within the field of saRNA genetic medicines.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

The study cohort comprised 3623 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were hospitalized in the SALUD hospital network of Aragon (Spain), which includes 23 hospitals, between February 2020 and January 2021, a period that includes several pandemic waves. Up to 165 variables were analysed, including demographics, comorbidity, chronic drugs, vital signs, and laboratory data. To build the predictive models, different techniques and machine learning (ML) algorithms were explored: multilayer perceptron, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). A reduction dimensionality procedure was used to minimize the features to 20, ensuring feasible use of the tool in practice. Our model was validated both internally and externally. We also assessed its calibration and provide an analysis of the optimal cut-off points depending on the metric to be optimized. The best performing algorithm was XGBoost. The final model achieved good discrimination for the external validation set (AUC = 0.821, 95% CI 0.787-0.854) and accurate calibration (slope = 1, intercept = -0.12). A cut-off of 0.4 provides a sensitivity and specificity of 0.71 and 0.78, respectively. In conclusion, we built a risk prediction model from a large amount of data from several pandemic waves, which had good calibration and discrimination ability. We also created a user-friendly web application that can aid rapid decision-making in clinical practice.</AbstractText></Abstract>",0,2021-09-06 00:00:00

                <AbstractText>Viral shedding patterns and their correlations with immune responses are still poorly characterized in mild coronavirus (CoV) disease 2019 (COVID-19). We monitored shedding of viral RNA and infectious virus and characterized the immune response kinetics of the first five patients quarantined in Geneva, Switzerland. High viral loads and infectious virus shedding were observed from the respiratory tract despite mild symptoms, with isolation of infectious virus and prolonged positivity by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) until days 7 and 19 after symptom onset, respectively. Robust innate responses characterized by increases in activated CD14<sup>+</sup> CD16<sup>+</sup> monocytes and cytokine responses were observed as early as 2 days after symptom onset. Cellular and humoral severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2-specific adaptive responses were detectable in all patients. Infectious virus shedding was limited to the first week after symptom onset. A strong innate response, characterized by mobilization of activated monocytes during the first days of infection and SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, was detectable even in patients with mild disease.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> This work is particularly important because it simultaneously assessed the virology, immunology, and clinical presentation of the same subjects, whereas other studies assess these separately. We describe the detailed viral and immune profiles of the first five patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 and quarantined in Geneva, Switzerland. Viral loads peaked at the very beginning of the disease, and infectious virus was shed only during the early acute phase of disease. No infectious virus could be isolated by culture 7 days after onset of symptoms, while viral RNA was still detectable for a prolonged period. Importantly, we saw that all patients, even those with mild symptoms, mount an innate response sufficient for viral control (characterized by early activated cytokines and monocyte responses) and develop specific immunity as well as cellular and humoral SARS-CoV-2-specific adaptive responses, which already begin to decline a few months after the resolution of symptoms.</AbstractText>

A metadata analysis informed by digital forensics and trace ethnography is employed to model the overlapping temporal, format-related, and annotation characteristics present in a corpus of repair manual files crowdsourced during collaborations between volunteer archivists and professional technicians. The corpus originates within iFixit.com's Medical Device Repair collection, a trove of more than 10,000 manuals contributed by working technicians in response to the strain placed on their colleagues and institutions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The study focuses in particular on the Respiratory Analyzer subcategory of documents, which aid in the maintenance of equipment central to the care of COVID-19 patients experiencing respiratory symptoms. The 40 Respiratory Analyzer manuals in iFixit's collection are examined in terms of their original publication date, the apparent status of their original paper copies, the version of PDF used to encode them, and any additional metadata that is present. Based on these characteristics, the study advances a conceptual model accounting for circulation among multiple technicians, as well as alteration of documents during the course of their lifespans.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>© 2021 Association for Information Science and Technology.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>",0,2021-07-08 00:00:00

                <AbstractText Label=""INTRODUCTION"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"">In March 2020, Australian state and federal governments introduced physical distancing measures alongside widespread testing to combat COVID-19. These measures may decrease people's sexual contacts and thus reduce the transmission of HIV and other sexually transmissible infections (STIs). We investigated the impact of physical distancing measures due to COVID-19 on the sexual behavior of gay and bisexual men in Australia.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">Between April 4, 2020, and April 29, 2020, 940 participants in an ongoing cohort study responded to questions to measure changes in sexual behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Men reported the date they become concerned about COVID-19 and whether they engaged in sexual behavior with regular or casual partners or ""fuckbuddies"" in the 6 months before becoming concerned about COVID-19 (hereafter referred to as ""before COVID-19""), and following the date, they become concerned about COVID-19 (hereafter referred to as ""since COVID-19""). Before and since COVID-19 was based on individual participants' own perceived date of becoming concerned about COVID-19.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">The mean age of was 39.9 years (SD: 13.4). Most participants (88.3%) reported sex with other men during the 6 months before COVID-19. Of the 587 men (62.4%) who reported sex with casual partners before COVID-19, 93 (15.8%) continued to do so in the period since COVID-19, representing a relative reduction of 84.2%.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Gay and bisexual men in Australia have dramatically reduced their sexual contacts with other men since COVID-19. These behavioral changes will likely result in short-term reductions in new HIV and STI diagnoses. If sexual health screenings are undertaken before resuming sexual activity, this could present a novel opportunity to interrupt chains of HIV and STI transmission.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>In response to COVID-19, the international water community rapidly developed methods to quantify the SARS-CoV-2 genetic signal in untreated wastewater. Wastewater surveillance using such methods has the potential to complement clinical testing in assessing community health. This interlaboratory assessment evaluated the reproducibility and sensitivity of 36 standard operating procedures (SOPs), divided into eight method groups based on sample concentration approach and whether solids were removed. Two raw wastewater samples were collected in August 2020, amended with a matrix spike (betacoronavirus OC43), and distributed to 32 laboratories across the U.S. Replicate samples analyzed in accordance with the project's quality assurance plan showed high reproducibility across the 36 SOPs: 80% of the recovery-corrected results fell within a band of ±1.15 log<sub>10</sub> genome copies per L with higher reproducibility observed within a single SOP (standard deviation of 0.13 log<sub>10</sub>). The inclusion of a solids removal step and the selection of a concentration method did not show a clear, systematic impact on the recovery-corrected results. Other methodological variations <i>(e.g.,</i> pasteurization, primer set selection, and use of RT-qPCR or RT-dPCR platforms) generally resulted in small differences compared to other sources of variability. These findings suggest that a variety of methods are capable of producing reproducible results, though the same SOP or laboratory should be selected to track SARS-CoV-2 trends at a given facility. The methods showed a 7 log<sub>10</sub> range of recovery efficiency and limit of detection highlighting the importance of recovery correction and the need to consider method sensitivity when selecting methods for wastewater surveillance.</AbstractText>

Less attention was paid to the experiences of individuals and less still to the impact of COVID-19 on an individual's wellbeing. This research addresses this gap by utilising a holistic wellbeing framework to examine the impact of COVID-19 on the overall wellbeing of individuals in the Australian state of South Australia through an online survey. The research framework for the survey comprises six dimensions: psychological and emotional health, physical health, living standards, family and community vitality, governance, and ecological diversity and resilience. The results show that most respondents (71%) were able to maintain overall wellbeing during the pandemic. However, more than a half of the respondents could not maintain wellbeing in psychological and emotional health. Further examination of the drivers of inability to maintain overall wellbeing reveals that low-income individuals, younger respondents (aged 18-24) and women suffer disproportionate hardships. Defining poverty in terms of multi-dimensional deprivations in wellbeing enables a nuanced analysis of the unequal impacts of COVID-19 mitigation policies that can be used to improve policymaking.</AbstractText></Abstract>",0,2021-06-23 00:00:00

                <AbstractText>Although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes cardiac dysfunction in up to 25% of patients, its pathogenesis remains unclear. Exposure of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived heart cells to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) revealed productive infection and robust transcriptomic and morphological signatures of damage, particularly in cardiomyocytes. Transcriptomic disruption of structural genes corroborates adverse morphologic features, which included a distinct pattern of myofibrillar fragmentation and nuclear disruption. Human autopsy specimens from patients with COVID-19 reflected similar alterations, particularly sarcomeric fragmentation. These notable cytopathic features in cardiomyocytes provide insights into SARS-CoV-2-induced cardiac damage, offer a platform for discovery of potential therapeutics, and raise concerns about the long-term consequences of COVID-19 in asymptomatic and severe cases.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label=""OBJECTIVE"" NlmCategory=""OBJECTIVE"">The management of laryngotracheal stenosis is challenging, as patients usually require in-time interventions. The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has added unique challenges to this procedure. The presence of the virus in high concentrations in the aerodigestive tract and the need for an open airway during surgery can increase the risk of aerosolization of the virus and subsequent infection of the surgical, anesthetic, and operating room (OR) personnel.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Because asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 produce respiratory droplets that can remain suspended in air for several hours, social distancing may not be a reliable physical barrier to transmission. During the COVID-19 pandemic, however, some governments were reluctant to mandate public mask use out of concern this would worsen shortages of respirators for healthcare workers. Cloth masks with a filtering effectiveness of 70-90% can be made from widely available materials, and are a better option than respirators for the public. Countries could rapidly implement Effective Fiber Mask Programs (EFMPs) to use local resources to mass produce effective and affordable cloth masks, and to engage the public in their correct use. EFMPs could be a cost-effective measure to ease isolation while limiting new infections during pandemics. EFMPs could also protect healthcare workers by increasing the supply of respirators for their use, reducing their risk of acquiring the illness from their communities, and by reducing the number of patients they must treat.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Usually, pandemic COVID-19 disease, caused by SARS-CoV2, presents with mild respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough, but frequently also with anosmia and neurological symptoms. Virus-cell fusion is mediated by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) with their organ expression pattern determining viral tropism. Clinical presentation suggests rapid viral dissemination to the central nervous system leading frequently to severe symptoms including viral meningitis. Here, we provide a comprehensive expression landscape of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins across human postmortem nasal and olfactory tissue. Sagittal sections through the human nose complemented with immunolabelling of respective cell types represent different anatomically defined regions including olfactory epithelium, respiratory epithelium of the nasal conchae and the paranasal sinuses along with the hardly accessible human olfactory bulb. ACE2 can be detected in the olfactory epithelium as well as in the respiratory epithelium of the nasal septum, the nasal conchae, and the paranasal sinuses. ACE2 is located in the sustentacular cells and in the glandular cells in the olfactory epithelium as well as in the basal cells, glandular cells, and epithelial cells of the respiratory epithelium. Intriguingly, ACE2 is not expressed in mature or immature olfactory receptor neurons and basal cells in the olfactory epithelium. Similarly, ACE2 is not localized in the olfactory receptor neurons albeit the olfactory bulb is positive. Vice versa, TMPRSS2 can also be detected in the sustentacular cells and the glandular cells of the olfactory epithelium. Our findings provide the basic anatomical evidence for the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the human nose, olfactory epithelium, and olfactory bulb. Thus, they are substantial for future studies that aim to elucidate the symptom of SARS-CoV2 induced anosmia via the olfactory pathway.</AbstractText>

The current study aims at gaining further insights into the behavior and characteristics of the DASCs isolated from the patient lung and exploring their clinical translational potential. Human DASCs were brushed off through the bronchoscopic procedure and expanded under the pharmaceutical-grade condition. Their phenotype stability in long-term cell culture was analyzed, followed by safety evaluation and tumorigenic analysis using multiple animal models including rodents and nonhuman primate. The chimerism of the human-mouse lung model indicated that DASC pedigrees could give rise to multiple epithelial types, including type I alveolar cells as well as bronchiolar secretory cells, to regenerate the distal lung. Taken together, the results suggested that DASC transplantation could be a promising therapeutic approach for unmet needs in respiratory medicine including the COVID-19-related diseases.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2021 Yueqing Zhou et al.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>",0,2021-09-29 00:00:00

                <AbstractText>Human populations are faced to the COVID-19 pandemic due to the emerging SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus originating from Wuhan (China) and with dramatic Public Health consequences. Despite periods of panic, the scientific community demonstrated an incredible innovation potential and energy ending up in one year with new vaccines to be used in population. Researchers are interrogating on how individual genetic differences contribute to the diversity of clinical manifestations or ethnic and geographic disparities of COVID-19. While efforts were spent to understand mechanistically the infectious potential of the virus, recent progresses in molecular genetics and bioinformatics allowed the characterization of viral sequence and construction of phylogeographical maps of viral dispersion worldwide. These data will help understanding epidemiological disparities among continents and ethnic populations. Much effort was also spent in analyzing host genetics by studying individual genes involved in innate and immune responses or explaining pathogenesis of comorbidities that complicate the fate of elderly patients. Several international consortia launched already <i>Genome wide Association Studies</i> (GWAS) and whole genome sequencing strategies to identify genetic markers with immediate application in patients at risk of respiratory failure. These new genetic data are important not only for understanding susceptibility factors for COVID-19 but they also contain an important message of hope for mankind warranting our survival and health.</AbstractText>

Different diagnostic laboratory tests have been used to detect the infection. Each diagnostic tool, such as Chest Computed tomography (CT) imaging, genome sequencing, nucleic acid amplification methods, whole genome sequencing, microarray, and serology testing have several advantages and disadvantages. Nucleic acid amplification methods are better diagnostic tools for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in early stages of the infection, while serological tests are more appropriate for the recognition of previously infected patients. In this review, we will briefly consider each diagnostic method, and discuss its pros and cons.</AbstractText>

The rapid mutation rate in the virus has created alarming situations worldwide and is being attributed to the false negativity in RT-PCR tests. It has also increased the chances of reinfection and immune escape. Recently various lineages namely, B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.617.1 (Kappa), B.1.617.2 (Delta) and B.1.617.3 have caused rapid infection around the globe. To understand the biophysical perspective, we have performed molecular dynamic simulations of four different spikes (receptor binding domain)-hACE2 complexes, namely wildtype (WT), Alpha variant (N501Y spike mutant), Kappa (L452R, E484Q) and Delta (L452R, T478K), and compared their dynamics, binding energy and molecular interactions. Our results show that mutation has caused significant increase in the binding energy between the spike and hACE2 in Alpha and Kappa variants. In the case of Kappa and Delta variants, the mutations at L452R, T478K and E484Q increased the stability and intra-chain interactions in the spike protein, which may change the interaction ability of neutralizing antibodies to these spike variants. Further, we found that the Alpha variant had increased hydrogen interaction with Lys353 of hACE2 and more binding affinity in comparison to WT. The current study provides the biophysical basis for understanding the molecular mechanism and rationale behind the increase in the transmissivity and infectivity of the mutants compared to wild-type SARS-CoV-2.</AbstractText></Abstract>",1,2021-09-14 00:00:00

                <AbstractText>We recognise that people lie to health professionals for several reasons. However, these incidents endanger the well-being of the professionals and bring us to the question of whether people have an exclusive moral duty to always profess the truth about their health and other facts, particularly in a pandemic crisis. This review argues that an honest patient is a key to undertaking their roles as health professionals and delivering the best services possible to meet the needs of the patient. Greater awareness and comprehension of the potential ramifications of dishonesty, not only helps establish the moral obligation, to tell the truth, particularly in a pandemic situation, but also translates into a better relationship with health professionals. It also enforces an ethical solidarity on every single of us to show tangible moral response to ensure that those most vulnerable to risks from the pandemic illness such as health professionals are protected as far as possible.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Physical activity (PA) is an important part of lifestyle management for adolescents with Type 1 diabetes (T1D). Opportunities for PA were reduced by COVID-19 restrictions. Therefore, the purpose of this cross-sectional study was to compare PA among adolescents with and without T1D during the first New Zealand (NZ) COVID-19 lockdown. PA levels of adolescents aged 11-18 years with T1D (<i>n</i> = 33) and healthy controls (<i>n</i> = 34) were assessed through self-reported and parent proxy-reported questionnaires. Overall, PA levels during lockdown were below recommended levels. PA levels did not differ between T1D and control participants (<i>p</i> = 0.212) nor between genders (<i>p</i> = 0.149). Younger adolescents tended to be more active than older adolescents (<i>p</i> = 0.079). PA level was negatively associated with BMI z-score (<i>r</i> = -0.29, <i>p</i> = 0.026) but was not associated with socioeconomic status (SES) or T1D-related parameters. In the T1D group, higher HbA1c was associated with lower school decile (<i>r</i> = -0.58, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and higher BMI z-score (<i>r</i> = 0.68, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Overall, young people were insufficiently active during lockdown, and some sub-groups were more affected than others by the restrictions.

                <AbstractText>The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has overwhelmed healthcare systems requiring the rapid development of treatments, at least, to reduce COVID-19 severity. Drug repurposing offers a fast track. Here, we discuss the potential beneficial effects of statins in COVID-19 patients based on evidence that they may target virus receptors, replication, degradation, and downstream responses in infected cells, addressing both basic research and epidemiological information. Briefly, statins could modulate virus entry, acting on the SARS-CoV-2 receptors, ACE2 and CD147, and/or lipid rafts engagement. Statins, by inducing autophagy activation, could regulate virus replication or degradation, exerting protective effects. The well-known anti-inflammatory properties of statins, by blocking several molecular mechanisms, including NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasomes, could limit the ""cytokine storm"" in severe COVID-19 patients which is linked to fatal outcome. Finally, statin moderation of coagulation response activation may also contribute to improving COVID-19 outcomes.

PCR samples are obtained from upper or lower respiratory tract specimens. However, the sensitivity of PCR is known to have some limitations. We report on a patient who was admitted to our hospital with dyspnea, fever, cough, and history of contact with a SARS-CoV-2 infected relative. The initial chest computed tomography (CT) showed only minimal changes and SARS-CoV-2 PCR from a nasopharyngeal swab sample was negative. PCR results obtained from further nasopharyngeal swabs, qualified sputum samples, and from a lower respiratory tract specimen also remained negative. At day 13 after admission, a second chest CT showed radiological findings suspicious for viral pneumonia. Finally, serologic results showed high levels of immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin A antibodies against the S1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Many countries have seen a two-wave pattern in reported cases of coronavirus disease-19 during the 2020 pandemic, with a first wave during spring followed by the current second wave in late summer and autumn. Empirical data show that the characteristics of the effects of the virus do vary between the two periods. Differences in age range and severity of the disease have been reported, although the comparative characteristics of the two waves still remain largely unknown. Those characteristics are compared in this study using data from two equal periods of 3 and a half months. The first period, between 15th March and 30th June, corresponding to the entire first wave, and the second, between 1st July and 15th October, corresponding to part of the second wave, still present at the time of writing this article. Two hundred and four patients were hospitalized during the first period, and 264 during the second period. Patients in the second wave were younger and the duration of hospitalization and case fatality rate were lower than those in the first wave. In the second wave, there were more children, and pregnant and post-partum women. The most frequent signs and symptoms in both waves were fever, dyspnea, pneumonia, and cough, and the most relevant comorbidities were cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and chronic neurological diseases. Patients from the second wave more frequently presented renal and gastrointestinal symptoms, were more often treated with non-invasive mechanical ventilation and corticoids, and less often with invasive mechanical ventilation, conventional oxygen therapy and anticoagulants. Several differences in mortality risk factors were also observed. These results might help to understand the characteristics of the second wave and the behaviour and danger of SARS-CoV-2 in the Mediterranean area and in Western Europe. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings.</AbstractText>

An increased risk of mortality following COVID-19 was observed in those aged ≥51 years, patients in farming occupation (aOR 7.56, 95% CI 1.70 to 33.53) and those presenting with cough (aOR 2.06, 95% CI 1.41 to 3.01), breathing difficulties (aOR 5.68, 95% CI 3.77 to 8.58) and vomiting (aOR 2.54, 95% CI 1.33 to 4.84).</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">The significant risk factors associated with COVID-19 positivity and subsequent mortality in the Nigerian population are similar to those reported in studies from other countries and should guide clinical decisions for COVID-19 testing and specialist care referrals.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>COVID-19 is a buzz word nowadays. The deadly virus that started in China has spread worldwide. The fundamental principle is ""if the disease can travel faster information has to travel even faster"". The sequence of events reveals the upheaval need to strengthen the ability of the early warning system, risk reduction, and management of national and global risks. Digital contact tracing apps like Aarogya setu (India) and Pan-European privacy preserving proximity tracing (German) has somehow helped but they are more effective in the initial stage and less relevant in the community spread phase. Thus, there is a need to devise a Decision Support System (DSS) based on machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we have attempted to propose an Additive Utility Assumption Approach for Criterion Comparison in Multi-criterion Intelligent Decision Support system for COVID-19. The dataset of Covid-19 has been taken from government link for validating the results. In this paper, an additive utility assumption-based approach for multi-criterion decision support system (MCDSS) with an accurate prediction of identified risk factors on certain well-defined input parameters is proposed and validated empirically using the standard SEIR model approach (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected and Recovered). The results includes comparative analysis in tabular form with already existing approaches to illustrate the potential of the proposed approach including the parameters such as Precision, Recall and F-Score. Other advanced parameters such as, MCC (Matthews Correlation Coefficient), ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics) and PRC (Precision Recall) have also been considered for validation and the graphs are illustrated using Jupyter notebook. The statistical analysis of the most affected top eight states of India is undertaken effectively using the Weka software tool and IBM Cognos software to correctly predict the outbreak of pandemic situation due to Covid-19. Finally, the article has immense potential to contribute to the COVID-19 situation and may prove to be instrumental in propelling the research interest of researchers and providing some useful insights for the current pandemic situation.</AbstractText>

The need for robust infectious disease surveillance to detect emerging pathogens along with common human pathogens has been highlighted by the ongoing novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The African Network for Improved Diagnostics, Epidemiology and Management of Common Infectious Agents (ANDEMIA) is a sentinel surveillance study on the aetiology and clinical characteristics of ARI, GI and AFDUC in sub-Saharan Africa.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">ANDEMIA includes 12 urban and rural health care facilities in four African countries (Côte d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Republic of South Africa). It was piloted in 2018 in Côte d'Ivoire and the initial phase will run from 2019 to 2021. Case definitions for ARI, GI and AFDUC were established, as well as syndrome-specific sampling algorithms including the collection of blood, naso- and oropharyngeal swabs and stool. Samples are tested using comprehensive diagnostic protocols, ranging from classic bacteriology and antimicrobial resistance screening to multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) systems and High Throughput Sequencing. In March 2020, PCR testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and analysis of full genomic information was included in the study. Standardised questionnaires collect relevant clinical, demographic, socio-economic and behavioural data for epidemiologic analyses. Controls are enrolled over a 12-month period for a nested case-control study. Data will be assessed descriptively and aetiologies will be evaluated using a latent class analysis among cases. Among cases and controls, an integrated analytic approach using logistic regression and Bayesian estimation will be employed to improve the assessment of aetiology and associated risk factors.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""DISCUSSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">ANDEMIA aims to expand our understanding of ARI, GI and AFDUC aetiologies in sub-Saharan Africa using a comprehensive laboratory diagnostics strategy. It will foster early detection of emerging threats and continued monitoring of important common pathogens. The network collaboration will be strengthened and site diagnostic capacities will be reinforced to improve quality management and patient care.</AbstractText></Abstract>",0,2021-06-11 00:00:00

We used an innovative online diary instrument that has proved both reliable and quick-to-field. Combining diary information on activity, location, and co-presence to estimate infection risks associated with daily behavior, we show clear changes in risk-associated behavior between the pre, full-lockdown and post full-lockdown periods. We document a shift from more to less risky daily behavior patterns (combinations of activity/location/co-presence categories) between the pre-pandemic pattern and full lockdown in May/June 2020, followed by a reversion (although not a complete reversal) of those patterns in August 2020 following the end of the first lockdown. Because, in general, a populations' time use changes relatively slowly, the behavioral changes revealed may be interpreted as a consequence of the UK COVID-19 lockdown social restrictions and their subsequent relaxation.</AbstractText>

Here, we developed a trimeric SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) subunit vaccine candidate that simulates the natural structure of the spike (S) trimer glycoprotein. Immunization with the RBD trimer-induced robust humoral and cellular immune responses, and a high level of neutralizing antibodies was maintained for at least 4.5 months. Moreover, the antibodies that were produced in response to the vaccine effectively cross-neutralized the SARS-CoV-2 501Y.V2 variant (B.1.351). Of note, when the vaccine-induced antibodies dropped to a sufficiently low level, only one boost quickly activated the anamnestic immune response, conferring full protection against a SARS-CoV-2 challenge in rhesus macaques without typical histopathological changes in the lung tissues. These results demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD trimer vaccine candidate is highly immunogenic and safe, providing long-lasting, broad, and significant immunity protection in nonhuman primates, thereby offering an optimal vaccination strategy against COVID-19.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>© 2021 The Author(s).</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>",1,2021-07-09 00:00:00

                <AbstractText>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was firstly reported at the end of 2019. The disease rapidly spread all around the world in a few months and was declared a worldwide pandemic by WHO in March 2020. By April 9, there were 1,436,198 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the world, nearly with 6% mortality rate. This novel infectious disease causes respiratory tract illness that may generally occur as mild upper respiratory tract disease or pneumonia. In older patients and/or patients with underlying conditions, it may result in acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi organ failure and even death. According to the current literature, children account approximately for 1%–5% of diagnosed COVID-19 cases. Generally, COVID-19 seems to be a less severe disease for children than adults. Approximately 90% of pediatric patients are diagnosed as asymptomatic, mild, or moderate disease. However, up to 6.7% of cases may be severe. Severe illness is generally seen in patients smaller than 1 year of age and patients who have underlying disesases. The epidemiological and clinical patterns of COVID-19 and treatment approaches in pediatric patients still remain unclear although many pediatric reports are published. This review aims to summarize the current epidemics, clinical presentations, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19 in pediatric patients.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>The COVID-19 pandemic revealed that there is a loss of smell in many patients, including in infected but otherwise asymptomatic individuals. The underlying mechanisms for the olfactory symptoms are unclear. Using a mouse model, we determined whether cells in the olfactory epithelium express the obligatory receptors for entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus by using RNAseq, RT-PCR, in situ hybridization, Western blot, and immunocytochemistry. We show that the cell surface protein ACE2 and the protease TMPRSS2 are expressed in sustentacular cells of the olfactory epithelium but not, or much less, in most olfactory receptor neurons. These data suggest that sustentacular cells are involved in SARS-CoV-2 virus entry and impairment of the sense of smell in COVID-19 patients. We also show that expression of the entry proteins increases in animals of old age. This may explain, if true also in humans, why individuals of older age are more susceptible to the SARS-CoV-2 infection.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"">COVID-19 (COronaVIrus Disease 2019) is an infectious respiratory disease caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus. Point of Care (POC) tests have been developed to detect specific antibodies, IgG and IgM, to SARS-CoV-2 virus in human whole blood. They need to be easily usable by the general population in order to alleviate the lockdown that many countries have initiated in response to the growing COVID-19 pandemic. A real-life study has been conducted in order to evaluate the performance of the COVID-PRESTO® POC test and the results were recently published. Even if this test showed very high sensitivity and specificity in a laboratory setting when used by trained professionals, it needs to be further evaluated for practicability when used by the general public in order to be approved by health authorities for in-home use.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">143 participants were recruited between March 2020 and April 2020 among non-medical populations in central France (nuclear plant workers, individuals attending the Orleans University Hospital vaccination clinic and Orleans University Hospital non-medical staff). Instructions for use, with or without a tutorial video, were made available to the volunteers. Two separate objectives were pursued: evaluation of the capability of participants to obtain an interpretable result, and evaluation of the users' ability to read the results.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">88.4% of the test users judged the instructions for use leaflet to be clear and understandable. 99.3% of the users obtained a valid result and, according to the supervisors, 92.7% of the tests were properly performed by the users. Overall, 95% of the users gave positive feedback on the COVID PRESTO® as a potential self-test. Neither age nor education had an influence.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">COVID-PRESTO® was successfully used by an overwhelming majority of participants and its use was judged very satisfactory, therefore showing promising potential as a self-test to be used by the general population. This POC test can become an easy-to-use tool to help detect whether individuals are protected or not, particularly in the context of a second wave or a mass vaccination program.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Initial reports suggest that mental health problems were elevated early in the COVID-19 pandemic. However, few studies have followed-up participants as the pandemic evolved and examined both between and within person predictors of symptom trajectories. In the current study, adolescents and young adults (N=532) in New York were surveyed monthly between March 27<sup>th</sup> and July 14<sup>th</sup>, 2020, a period spanning the first peak and subsequent decline in COVID-19 infection rates in the region. Surveys assessed symptoms of depression and anxiety using the Child Depression Inventory and the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders, as well as experiences related to the pandemic. Multilevel growth modeling indicated that symptoms of depression and anxiety peaked around late April/early May and then decreased through May-July. Some pandemic experiences followed a similar quadratic trajectory, while others decreased linearly across the study. Specific relationships emerged between some types of pandemic experiences and depression and anxiety symptoms. While symptoms of depression and anxiety in youth may have been elevated early in the pandemic, these findings suggest they subsided across Spring-Summer of 2020, with higher levels of both corresponding to a period of peak infection rates and decreases paralleling the decline in pandemic experiences and COVID-19 infection rates.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label=""STUDY OBJECTIVES"" NlmCategory=""OBJECTIVE"">By March 2020, COVID-19 forced much of the world to stay at home to reduce the spread of the disease. Whereas some health care workers transitioned to working from home, many continued to report to work in person as essential employees. We sought to explore changes in sleep, health, work, and mood in health care workers during the stay-at-home orders.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">We developed a cross-sectional online survey administered to health care workers. The survey assessed changes in sleep, work, screen time, media exposure, diet, exercise, substance use, and mood. The survey data were collected between March 28, 2020, and April 29, 2020.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">A total of 834 of 936 individuals completed the entire survey. Respondents were from 41 US states. Mood after the stay-at-home orders worsened, and screen time and substance use increased. Total sleep time shortened in those continuing to work in person (P &lt; .001), whereas it was unchanged in those working from home (P = .73). Those working from home went to bed later, woke up later, and worked fewer hours. Reduced total sleep time and increased screen time before bed were associated with worse mood and screen time. Longer sleep time was associated with better mood.</AbstractText>

This qualitative study explores how a diverse group of low-income, urban-living older adults use mobility and technology for social participation. We conducted six focus groups (<i>N</i> = 48), two each in English, Spanish, and Korean at a Los Angeles senior center. Three major themes emerged from thematic analysis: using technology for mobility; links between mobility and social participation; and technology-mediated social participation. Cost, perceived safety, (dis)ability, and support from family and friends were related to mobility and technology use. This study demonstrates the range of mobility and technology uses among older adults and associated barriers. The findings can help establish a pre-COVID-19 baseline on how to make mobility and technology more accessible for older adults at risk of isolation.</AbstractText></Abstract>",0,2021-06-06 00:00:00

                <AbstractText><b>Background and Aims:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic poses a great challenge to healthcare. We aimed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on the healthcare of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in epicenter and non-epicenter areas. <b>Methods:</b> Patients with IBD from Hubei province (the epicenter of COVID-19) and Guangdong province (a non-epicenter area), China were surveyed during the pandemic. The questionnaire included change of medications (steroids, immunomodulators, and biologics), procedures (lab tests, endoscopy, and elective surgery), and healthcare mode (standard healthcare vs. telemedicine) during 1 month before and after the outbreak of COVID-19. <b>Results:</b> In total, 324 IBD patients from Guangdong province (non-epicenter) and 149 from Hubei province (epicenter) completed the questionnaire with comparable demographic characteristics. Compared to patients in Guangdong province (non-epicenter), significantly more patients in Hubei (epicenter) had delayed lab tests/endoscopy procedures [61.1% (91/149) vs. 25.3% (82/324), <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001], drug withdrawal [28.6% (43/149) vs. 9.3% (30/324), <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001], delayed biologics infusions [60.4% (90/149) vs. 19.1% (62/324), <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001], and postponed elective surgery [16.1% (24/149) vs. 3.7% (12/324), <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001]. There was an increased use of telemedicine after the outbreak compared to before the outbreak in Hubei province [38.9% (58/149) vs. 15.4% (23/149), <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001], while such a significant increase was not observed in Guangdong province [21.9% (71/324) vs. 18.8% (61/324), <i>p</i> = 0.38]. Approximately two-thirds of IBD patients from both sites agreed that telemedicine should be increasingly used in future medical care. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our patient-based survey study in a real-world setting showed that COVID-19 resulted in a great impact on the healthcare of patients with IBD, and such an impact was more obvious in the epicenter compared to the non-epicenter area of COVID-19. Telemedicine offers a good solution to counteract the challenges in an unprecedented situation such as COVID-19.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>In December 2019, a cluster of cases with 2019 Novel Coronavirus pneumonia from Wuhan, China, aroused worldwide concern due to an escalating outbreak in all the countries in the world. Coronavirus belongs to a family of single-stranded RNA viruses, which includes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), that have caused human epidemics with high fatality. The spectrum of the novel coronavirus disease (SARS-Co-2 or COVID-19) ranges from asymptomatic infections to fatal pneumonia, and differs from other viral pulmonary infections. MERS-CoV is known to be potentially neuroinvasive. Extensive reports from China documented central and peripheral nervous system involvement in patients with COVID-19, and identified in angiotensin converting enzyme2 (ACE2), which is present in multiple human organs, the functional receptor for this virus. Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) has recently been associated to COVID-19 rising concern among physicians. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge on GBS during or after COVID-19 infection, attempting to clarify the pathophysiology of the associated respiratory dysfunction and failure.</AbstractText>

Knowledge of the relationship between these four variables examined further understanding of the PR improvement mechanism of college students and even the general public. <b>Methods:</b> The college students who participated in this study came from an independent college in Guangdong Province, China. A total of 918 college students completed the survey, and the final data sample size was 881. SPSS 23.0 and PROCESS (version 3.3) were used to conduct Pearson's correlation analysis and hierarchical regression linear analysis on the data. <b>Results:</b> (1) The correlation analysis showed that GSE and PR were positively correlated and that PTG was positively correlated with GSE and PR. DR was positively correlated with GSE, PTG, and PR. (2) The results of mediation analysis showed that GSE had a direct predictive effect on DR, and PTG partially mediated the relationship between the two. (3) The results of moderating effect analysis showed that DR hindered the effect of GSE on PTG but enhanced the positive impact of PTG on PR. <b>Conclusions:</b> General self-efficacy can improve PR under the mediating influence of PTG. DR played a positive moderating role in the relationship between GSE and PTG, and played a negative moderating role in the relationship between PTG and PR.

                <AbstractText>SARS-CoV2 is a previously uncharacterized coronavirus and causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. The host response to SARS-CoV2 has not yet been fully delineated, hampering a precise approach to therapy. To address this, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of gene expression data from the blood, lung, and airway of COVID-19 patients. Our results indicate that COVID-19 pathogenesis is driven by populations of myeloid-lineage cells with highly inflammatory but distinct transcriptional signatures in each compartment. The relative absence of cytotoxic cells in the lung suggests a model in which delayed clearance of the virus may permit exaggerated myeloid cell activation that contributes to disease pathogenesis by the production of inflammatory mediators. The gene expression profiles also identify potential therapeutic targets that could be modified with available drugs. The data suggest that transcriptomic profiling can provide an understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 in individual patients.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label=""AIM"" NlmCategory=""OBJECTIVE"">As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, human milk banks world-wide continue to provide donor human milk to vulnerable infants who lack access to mother's own milk. Under these circumstances, ensuring the safety of donor human milk is paramount, as the risk of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is not fully understood. Here, we investigate the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in human milk by pasteurisation and the stability of SARS-CoV-2 in human milk under cold storage.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">SARS-CoV-2 was experimentally inoculated into human milk samples from healthy donors or into a control medium. Triplicates of each sample were layered onto uninfected cells after Holder pasteurisation (63°C for 30 min), heating to 56°C for 30 min, or after 48 h of storage at 4°C or -30°C. Infectious titres of virus were determined at 72 h post-infection by endpoint titration.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">SARS-CoV-2 is effectively inactivated by Holder pasteurisation, suggesting that existing milk bank processes will effectively mitigate the risk of transmission of SARS-COV-2 to vulnerable infants through pasteurised donor human milk. The demonstrated stability of SARS-CoV-2 in refrigerated or frozen human milk may assist in the development of guidelines around safe expressing and storing of milk from COVID-19 infected mothers.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>COVID-19 has hit the world by surprise, causing substantial mortality and morbidity since 2020. This narrative review aims to provide an overview of the epidemiology, induced impact, viral kinetics and clinical spectrum of COVID-19 in the Asia-Pacific Region, focusing on regions previously exposed to outbreaks of coronavirus. COVID-19 progressed differently by regions, with some (such as China and Taiwan) featured by one to two epidemic waves and some (such as Hong Kong and South Korea) featured by multiple waves. There has been no consensus on the estimates of important epidemiological time intervals or proportions, such that using them for making inferences should be done with caution. Viral loads of patients with COVID-19 peak in the first week of illness around days 2 to 4 and hence there is very high transmission potential causing community outbreaks. Various strategies such as government-guided and suppress-and-lift strategies, trigger-based/suppression approaches and alert systems have been employed to guide the adoption and easing of control measures. Asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission is a hallmark of COVID-19. Identification and isolation of symptomatic patients alone is not effective in controlling the ongoing outbreaks. However, early, prompt and coordinated enactment predisposed regions to successful disease containment. Mass COVID-19 vaccinations are likely to be the light at the end of the tunnel. There is a need to review what we have learnt in this pandemic and examine how to transfer and improve existing knowledge for ongoing and future epidemics.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>The fields of science education and science communication are said to have developed as disparate fields of research and practice, operating based on somewhat different logics and premises about their audiences. As the two fields share many of the same goals, arguments have been made for a rapprochement between the two. Drawing inspiration from a historical debate between the scholars John Dewey and Walter Lippmann, the present article is a case-oriented theoretical contribution applying models from science education and science communication in relation to a current socio-scientific issue (SSI), the COVID-19 pandemic. The main question of interest is how selected didactic (<i>didaktik</i>) models from science education and science communication can contribute to shed light on the present situation of an ongoing pandemic specifically and socio-scientific issues in general. Three models are synthesised to give a new composite model that may help communicators and educators understand, discuss, and analyse complex socio-scientific issues. The model is subsequently applied on the apparently contradictory issue of Norwegian and Swedish governments' very different responses to the pandemic, despite grounding their decisions on largely the same scientific evidence and advice. Contrast is made by comparison with another SSI, anthropogenic global warming (AGW). It is argued that the exchange and combination of didactic models from the two fields may open new spaces for cross-pollination and cross-fertilisation to the mutual benefit of both science education and science communication.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"">Patients with cancer are particularly vulnerable to stress and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. Social distancing is critical for patients with cancer, yet this can also reduce access to psychosocial coping resources.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""OBJECTIVE"" NlmCategory=""OBJECTIVE"">This study aimed to explore patient experiences to generate a model of how virtual mind-body programs can support the psychosocial well-being of patients with cancer.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">We conducted a qualitative study among patients (ages ≥18) who participated in a virtual mind-body program offered by a National Cancer Institute-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center during COVID-19. The program consisted of mind-body group therapy sessions in fitness, yoga, tai chi, dance therapy, music therapy, and meditation. Live integrative medicine clinicians held each session via Zoom video conferencing for 30 to 45 minutes. In semi-structured phone interviews (n=30), patients were asked about overall impressions and perceptions of the session's benefit, including impacts on stress and anxiety. Interviews were analyzed using grounded theory.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">Among participants [n=30, age 64.5 range 40-80, 96.7% female], three major themes were identified relating to experiences in the virtual mind-body program: (1) Sessions helped in maintaining structured routines, and motivating patients to adhere to healthy behaviors; (2) sessions enhanced coping with COVID-19-related stressors allowing patients to ""refocus"" and ""re-energize""; (3) sessions allowed patients to connect, fostering social relationships during a time of isolation. These themes informed the constructs of a novel Behavioral-Psychological-Social Coping model for patients with cancer.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Virtual Mind-Body programming supported cancer patients during COVID-19 through a Behavioral-Psychological-Social Coping model, by enhancing phycological coping for external stressors, supporting adherence to motivation and health behaviors, and increasing social connection and camaraderie. These programs have potential to address the behavioral, psychological, and social challenges faced by patients with cancer during and beyond COVID-19. The constructs of the conceptual model proposed in this study can inform future interventions to support isolated cancer patients. Further clinical trials are needed to confirm the specific benefit of virtual mind-body programming for cancer patients' psychosocial well-being and healthy behaviors.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label=""Material and Methods"">Telephone interviews were conducted using a validated questionnaire to investigate pelvic floor symptoms. Patients were also asked if they had other symptoms or disorders, to identify patients who may need urgent hospital evaluation. At the end of the phone call, patients were asked to score their satisfaction with the telephone interview by grading their response to three questions from 0 (minimum) to 10 (maximum). The questions were: 1) “Was the telephone interview useful to check your state of health?”; 2) “Was the telephone interview an adequate healthcare tool in consideration of COVID-19 outbreak?”; 3) “Could the telephone interview replace the conventional visit?”.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""Results"">Fifty-three patients were evaluated. All patients showed great satisfaction with telephone interview (Q1 median: 10, IQ range: 10-10) and were similarly positive in response to the second question (Q2 median: 10, IQ range: 10-10). Although fewer patients felt that telephone interview could replace conventional clinic visits most remained positive (Q3 median: 7; IQ range: 6-8).</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Virus-like particles (VLPs) are virus-derived structures made up of one or more different molecules with the ability to self-assemble, mimicking the form and size of a virus particle but lacking the genetic material so they are not capable of infecting the host cell. Expression and self-assembly of the viral structural proteins can take place in various living or cell-free expression systems after which the viral structures can be assembled and reconstructed. VLPs are gaining in popularity in the field of preventive medicine and to date, a wide range of VLP-based candidate vaccines have been developed for immunization against various infectious agents, the latest of which is the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the efficacy of which is being evaluated. VLPs are highly immunogenic and are able to elicit both the antibody- and cell-mediated immune responses by pathways different from those elicited by conventional inactivated viral vaccines. However, there are still many challenges to this surface display system that need to be addressed in the future. VLPs that are classified as subunit vaccines are subdivided into enveloped and non- enveloped subtypes both of which are discussed in this review article. VLPs have also recently received attention for their successful applications in targeted drug delivery and for use in gene therapy. The development of more effective and targeted forms of VLP by modification of the surface of the particles in such a way that they can be introduced into specific cells or tissues or increase their half-life in the host is likely to expand their use in the future. Recent advances in the production and fabrication of VLPs including the exploration of different types of expression systems for their development, as well as their applications as vaccines in the prevention of infectious diseases and cancers resulting from their interaction with, and mechanism of activation of, the humoral and cellular immune systems are discussed in this review.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label=""Introduction"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a dramatic unexplained decline in hospital admissions due to acute coronary syndromes and stroke. Several theories have emerged aiming to explain this decline, mostly revolving around the fear of contracting the disease and thus avoiding hospital visits.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""Aims"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">In this study, we aim to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on stroke admissions to a tertiary care centre in Qatar.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""Methods"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">The Hamad General Hospital stroke database was interrogated for stroke admissions between September 2019 and May 2020. The number of stroke admissions, stroke subtypes and short-term outcomes was compared between the 'pre-COVID-19' period (September 2019 to February 2020) and the COVID-19 pandemic period (March to May 2020).</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""Results"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">We observed a significant decline in monthly admissions in March (157), April (128) and May (135) compared with the pre-COVID-19 6-month average (229) (p=0.024). The reduction in admissions was most evident in functional stroke mimics. The average admissions decreased from 87 to 34 per month (p=0.0001). Although there were no significant differences in admissions due to ischaemic stroke (IS), intracranial haemorrhage or transient ischaemic attacks between the two periods, we noted a relative decrease in IS due to small vessel disease and an increase in those due to large vessel atherosclerosis in March to May 2020.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""Conclusions"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">The decline in overall stroke admissions during the COVID-19 pandemic is most likely related to concerns of contracting the infection, evidenced mainly by a decline in admissions of stroke mimics. However, a relative increase in large vessel occlusions raises suspicion of pathophysiological effects of the virus, and requires further investigation.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"">Evidence has shown the benefits of labour companions during childbirth. Few studies have documented the relationship between the absence of labour companions and mistreatment of women during childbirth in low-income and middle-income countries using a standardised tool.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">We conducted a secondary analysis of the WHO multi-country study on how women are treated during childbirth, where a cross-sectional community survey was conducted with women up to 8 weeks after childbirth in Ghana, Guinea, Nigeria and Myanmar. Descriptive analysis and multivariable logistic regression were used to examine whether labour companionship was associated with various types of mistreatment.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Of 2672 women, about half (50.4%) reported the presence of a labour companion. Approximately half (49.6%) of these women reported that the timing of support was during labour and after childbirth and most of the labour companions (47.0%) were their family members. Across Ghana, Guinea and Nigeria, women without a labour companion were more likely to report physical abuse, non-consented medical procedures and poor communication compared with women with a labour companion. However, there were country-level variations. In Guinea, the absence of labour companionship was associated with any physical abuse, verbal abuse, or stigma or discrimination (adjusted OR (AOR) 3.6, 1.9-6.9) and non-consented vaginal examinations (AOR 3.2, 1.6-6.4). In Ghana, it was associated with non-consented vaginal examinations (AOR 2.3, 1.7-3.1) and poor communication (AOR 2.0, 1.3-3.2). In Nigeria, it was associated with longer wait times (AOR 0.6, 0.3-0.9).</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">Labour companionship is associated with lower levels of some forms of mistreatment that women experience during childbirth, depending on the setting. Further work is needed to ascertain how best to implement context-specific labour companionship to ensure benefits while maintaining women's choices and autonomy.</AbstractText>

To mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Philippine national government through its Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases outlined different quarantine measures wherein each level has a corresponding degree of rigidity from keeping only the essential businesses open to allowing all establishments to operate at a certain capacity. Other measures also involve prohibiting individuals at a certain age bracket from going outside of their homes. The local government units (LGUs)-municipalities and provinces-can adopt any of these measures depending on the extent of the pandemic in their locality. The purpose is to keep the number of infections and mortality at bay while minimizing the economic impact of the pandemic. Some LGUs have demonstrated a remarkable response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study is to identify notable non-pharmaceutical interventions of these outlying LGUs in the country using quantitative methods.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">Data were taken from public databases such as Philippine Department of Health, Philippine Statistics Authority Census, and Google Community Mobility Reports. These are normalized using Z-transform. For each locality, infection and mortality data (dataset Y) were compared to the economic, health, and demographic data (dataset X) using Euclidean metric d=(x-y)<sup>2</sup>, where x∈X and y∈Y. If a data pair (x,y) exceeds, by two standard deviations, the mean of the Euclidean metric values between the sets X and Y, the pair is assumed to be a 'good' outlier.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Our results showed that cluster of cities and provinces in Central Luzon (Region III), CALABARZON (Region IV-A), the National Capital Region (NCR), and Central Visayas (Region VII) are the 'good' outliers with respect to factors such as working population, population density, ICU beds, doctors on quarantine, number of frontliners and gross regional domestic product. Among metropolitan cities, Davao was a 'good' outlier with respect to demographic factors.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Strict border control, early implementation of lockdowns, establishment of quarantine facilities, effective communication to the public, and monitoring efforts were the defining factors that helped these LGUs curtail the harm that was brought by the pandemic. If these policies are to be standardized, it would help any country's preparedness for future health emergencies.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>© 2021.

Since its first discovery in Dec 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has become a global pandemic and caused 3.3 million direct/indirect deaths (2021 May). Amongst the scientific communityâ€™s response to COVID-19, data sharing has emerged as an essential aspect of the combat against SARS-CoV-2. Despite the ever-growing studies about SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, to date, only a few databases were curated to enable access to gene expression data. Furthermore, these databases curated only a small set of data and do not provide easy access for investigators without computational skills to perform analyses. To fill this gap and advance open-access to the growing gene expression data on this deadly virus, we collected about 1,500 human bulk RNA-seq datasets from publicly available resources, developed a database and visualization tool, named CovidExpress ( https://stjudecab.github.io/covidexpress ). This open access database will allow research investigators to examine the gene expression in various tissues, cell lines, and their response to SARS-CoV-2 under different experimental conditions, accelerating the understanding of the etiology of this disease in order to inform the drug and vaccine development. Our integrative analysis of this big dataset highlights a set of commonly regulated genes in SARS-CoV-2 infected lung and nasal tissues, including OASL that were under-studied in COVID-19 related reports. Our results also suggested a potential FURIN positive feedback loop that might explain the evolutional advantage of SARS-CoV-2.</AbstractText></Abstract>",2,2021-08-15 00:00:00

However, the existing frameworks of data analysis are insufficient or inefficient to investigate the potential causality behind the associations involving multidimensional factors and complicated interrelationships. Thus, a causal inference framework equipped with the structural causal model aided by machine learning methods was proposed and applied to examine the potential causal relationships between COVID-19 severity and 10 environmental factors (NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, PM2.5, PM10, SO<sub>2</sub>, CO, average air temperature, atmospheric pressure, relative humidity, and wind speed) in 166 Chinese cities. The cities were grouped into three clusters based on the socio-economic features. Time-series data from these cities in each cluster were analyzed in different pandemic phases. The robustness check refuted most potential causal relationships' estimations (89 out of 90). Only one potential relationship about air temperature passed the final test with a causal effect of 0.041 under a specific cluster-phase condition. The results indicate that the environmental factors are unlikely to cause noticeable aggravation of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study also demonstrated the high value and potential of the proposed method in investigating causal problems with observational data in environmental or other fields.</AbstractText></Abstract>",0,2021-09-24 00:00:00

Rapid point-of-care (PoC) antigen tests are valuable tools but implementing frequent large scale testing is costly. We have developed an inexpensive device for pooling swabs, extracting specimens, and detecting viral antigens with a commercial lateral flow test for the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 as antigen. The holder of the device can be produced locally through 3D printing. The extraction and the elution can be performed with the entire set-up encapsulated in a transparent bag, minimizing the risk of infection for the operator. With 0.35 mL extraction buffer and six swabs, including a positive control swab, 43 ± 6% (<i>n</i> = 8) of the signal for an individual extraction of a positive control standard was obtained. Image analysis still showed a signal-to-noise ratio of approximately 2:1 at 32-fold dilution of the extract from a single positive control swab. The relative signal from the test line versus the control line was found to scale linearly upon dilution (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.98), indicating that other pooling regimes are conceivable. A pilot project involving 14 participants and 18 pooled tests in a laboratory course at our university did not give any false positives, and an individual case study confirmed the ability to detect a SARS-CoV-2 infection with five-fold or six-fold pooling, including one swab from a PCR-confirmed COVID patient. These findings suggest that pooling can make frequent testing more affordable for schools, universities, and similar institutions, without decreasing sensitivity to an unacceptable level.</AbstractText></Abstract>",0,2021-08-09 00:00:00

                <AbstractText>The global COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic has become a complex problem that overlaps with a growing public health problem, obesity. Obesity alters different components of the innate and adaptive immune responses, creating a chronic and low-grade state of inflammation. Nutritional status is closely related to a better or worse prognosis of viral infections. Excess weight has been recognised as a risk factor for COVID-19 complications. In addition to the direct risk, obesity triggers other diseases such as diabetes and hypertension, increasing the risk of severe COVID-19. The present review explains the diets that induce obesity and the importance of different foods in this process. We also review tissue disruption in obesity, leading to impaired immune responses and the possible mechanisms by which obesity and its co-morbidities increase COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Nutritional strategies that support the immune system in patients with obesity and with COVID-19 are also discussed in light of the available data, considering the severity of the infection. The discussions held may contribute to combating this global emergency and planning specific public health policy.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>The rapid emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a global pandemic affecting millions of individuals globally has necessitated sensitive and high-throughput approaches for the diagnosis, surveillance, and determining the genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, we used the COVIDSeq protocol, which involves multiplex-PCR, barcoding, and sequencing of samples for high-throughput detection and deciphering the genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. We used the approach on 752 clinical samples in duplicates, amounting to a total of 1536 samples which could be sequenced on a single S4 sequencing flow cell on NovaSeq 6000. Our analysis suggests a high concordance between technical duplicates and a high concordance of detection of SARS-CoV-2 between the COVIDSeq as well as RT-PCR approaches. An in-depth analysis revealed a total of six samples in which COVIDSeq detected SARS-CoV-2 in high confidence which were negative in RT-PCR. Additionally, the assay could detect SARS-CoV-2 in 21 samples and 16 samples which were classified inconclusive and pan-sarbeco positive respectively suggesting that COVIDSeq could be used as a confirmatory test. The sequencing approach also enabled insights into the evolution and genetic epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2 samples. The samples were classified into a total of 3 clades. This study reports two lineages B.1.112 and B.1.99 for the first time in India. This study also revealed 1,143 unique single nucleotide variants and added a total of 73 novel variants identified for the first time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the COVIDSeq approach for detection and genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. Our analysis suggests that COVIDSeq could be a potential high sensitivity assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, with an additional advantage of enabling the genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>The world is experiencing the worst global health crisis in recent decades since December/2019 due to a new pandemic coronavirus. The COVID-19 disease, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has resulted in more than 30 million cases and 950 thousand deaths worldwide as of September 21, 2020. Determining the extent of the virus on public surfaces is critical for understanding the potential risk of infection in these areas. In this study, we investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on public surfaces in a densely populated urban area in Brazil. Forty-nine of 933 samples tested positive (5.25%) for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, including samples collected from distinct material surfaces, including metal and concrete, and distinct places, mainly around hospital care units and public squares. Our data indicated the contamination of public surfaces by SARS-CoV-2, suggesting the circulation of infected patients and the risk of infection for the population. Constant monitoring of the virus in urban areas is required as a strategy to fight the pandemic and prevent further infections.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"">Older adults are at high risk for developing serious somatic and psychological symptoms associated with COVID-19. Currently available instruments may not be sensitive to the concerns about COVID-19 in postacute and long-term care and their applications in telehealth remain to be clarified.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""OBJECTIVE"" NlmCategory=""OBJECTIVE"">We investigated the psychometric properties of the Mood-5 Scale (M5) as a rapid self-assessment of the COVID-19 psychological burden among postacute and long-term care residents.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">Residents (N=131), aged 50 years and above, from 20 postacute and long-term care facilities in Maryland, USA, were evaluated in-person or via telehealth (43/131, 32.8%) across a 4-week period (May 11 to June 5, 2020) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 psychological burden experienced by the residents was rated by geriatric psychologists who independently reviewed their clinical documentation. Psychometric analyses were performed on the M5 in relation to psychological tests, COVID-19 psychological burden, and diagnostic data collected during the evaluation.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">The M5 demonstrated acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach α=.77). M5 scores were not confounded by demographic variables or telehealth administration (P&gt;.08). Convergent validity for the M5 was established via positive associations with anxiety (r=0.56, P&lt;.001) and depressive (r=0.49, P&lt;.001) symptoms. An M5 cutoff score of 3 demonstrated strong sensitivity (0.92) and adequate specificity (0.75) for identifying COVID-19 psychological distress among postacute and long-term care residents (area under the curve of 0.89, positive predictive value=0.79, negative predictive value=0.91).</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">The M5 is a reliable and valid tool for self-assessment of mood that can help identify postacute and long-term care residents with significant psychological burden associated with COVID-19. It can be completed in less than 1 minute and is appropriate for use in both in-person and virtual visits.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a rapid worldwide pandemic. While COVID-19 primarily manifests as an interstitial pneumonia and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, severe involvement of other organs has been documented. In this article, we will review the role of non-contrast chest computed tomography in the diagnosis, follow-up and prognosis of patients affected by COVID-19 pneumonia with a detailed description of the imaging findings that may be encountered. Given that patients with COVID-19 may also suffer from coagulopathy, we will discuss the role of CT pulmonary angiography in the detection of acute pulmonary embolism. Finally, we will describe more advanced applications of CT in the differential diagnosis of myocardial injury with an emphasis on ruling out acute coronary syndrome and myocarditis.</AbstractText>

As this method of education continues to be widely used, understanding the current trend of its usage is critical. In this study, we performed a survey study of virtual lecture attendees and presenters to determine current usage and general consensus on virtual lectures in plastic surgery education.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">An electronic survey was sent to attendees and presenters of virtual lectures using Google Forms. Demographic data, webinar usage patterns, and views on virtual lectures were collected.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">A total of 417 surveys were received. Prior to the COVID-19 era, 39.1percent of attendees did not use virtual lectures and 45.6percent of presenters did not give webinars at all. Both groups reported that the lack of opportunities and need were the most common cause of no use of lectures or webinars. After the outbreak, 35.4percent of attendees now use virtual lectures daily and 51.4percent of presenters give lectures weekly. Over 90percent of the study population reported a positive experience with the virtual lectures due to increased interaction, convenience, outreach, and usability. Finally, over 75percent stated that virtual lectures might replace classroom lectures in the future.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Our study shows that a majority of plastic surgeons have begun to use and give virtual lectures daily after the COVID-19 outbreak. Virtual education is a powerful and versatile tool that has great potentials, and it may continue to serve as a part of surgical training in the future.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label=""PURPOSE"">The COVID-19 pandemic presents serious challenges for brachytherapists, and in the time-sensitive case of locally advanced cervical cancer, the need for curative brachytherapy (BT) is critical for survival. Given the high-volume of locally advanced cervical cancer in our safety-net hospital, we developed a strategy in close collaboration with our gynecology oncology and anesthesia colleagues to allow for completely clinic-based intracavitary brachytherapy (ICBT).</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""METHODS AND MATERIALS"">This technical report will highlight our experience with the use of paracervical blocks (PCBs) and oral multimodal analgesia (MMA) for appropriately selected cervical ICBT cases, allowing for completely clinic-based treatment.</AbstractText>

The excluded patient had significant vaginal fibrosis. 38 of 39 intracavitary implants were successfully transitioned for entirely in-clinic treatment utilizing PCBs and oral MMA (97% success rate). One case was aborted due to inadequate analgesia secondary to a significantly delayed case start time (PO medication effect diminished). 95% of patients reported no pain at the conclusion of the procedure. The median (IQR) D<sub>2cc</sub> for rectum and bladder were 64.8 (58.6-70.2) Gy and 84.1 (70.9-89.4) Gy, respectively.

                <AbstractText>The protective capacity and duration of humoral immunity after SARS-CoV-2 infection are not yet understood in solid organ transplant recipients. A prospective multicenter study was performed to evaluate the persistence of anti-nucleocapsid IgG antibodies in liver transplant recipients 6 months after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) resolution. A total of 71 liver transplant recipients were matched with 71 immunocompetent controls by a propensity score including variables with a well-known prognostic impact in COVID-19. Paired case-control serological data were also available in 62 liver transplant patients and 62 controls at month 3 after COVID-19. Liver transplant recipients showed a lower incidence of anti-nucleocapsid IgG antibodies at 3 months (77.4% vs. 100%, p &lt; .001) and at 6 months (63.4% vs. 90.1%, p &lt; .001). Lower levels of antibodies were also observed in liver transplant patients at 3 (p = .001) and 6 months (p &lt; .001) after COVID-19. In transplant patients, female gender (OR = 13.49, 95% CI: 2.17-83.8), a longer interval since transplantation (OR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.03-1.36), and therapy with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (OR = 7.11, 95% CI: 1.47-34.50) were independently associated with persistence of antibodies beyond 6 months after COVID-19. Therefore, as compared with immunocompetent patients, liver transplant recipients show a lower prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and more pronounced antibody levels decline.</AbstractText>

In the present study, 11 Brazilian office workers (five women, six men; mean [SD] age 39.3 [9.6] years) wore two triaxial accelerometers fixed on the upper back and right thigh continuously for five days, including a weekend, before COVID-19 (September 2019), and again while working at home during COVID-19 (July 2020). We determined time used in five behaviours: sedentary, standing, light physical activity (LPA), moderate-to-vigorous activity (MVPA), and time-in-bed. Data on these behaviours were processed using Compositional Data Analysis, and behaviours observed pre-COVID19 and during-COVID19 were compared using repeated-measures MANOVA. On workdays during-COVID19, participants spent 667 min sedentary, 176 standing, 74 LPA, 51 MVPA and 472 time-in-bed; corresponding numbers pre-COVID were 689, 180, 81, 72 and 418 min. Tests confirmed that less time was spent in bed pre-COVID19 (log-ratio -0.12 [95% CI -0.19; -0.08]) and more time in MVPA (log-ratio 0.35, [95% CI 0.08; 0.70]).

                <AbstractText>We propose a deterministic model capturing essential features of contact tracing as part of public health non-pharmaceutical interventions to mitigate an outbreak of an infectious disease. By incorporating a mechanistic formulation of the processes at the individual level, we obtain an integral equation (delayed in calendar time and advanced in time since infection) for the probability that an infected individual is detected and isolated at any point in time. This is then coupled with a renewal equation for the total incidence to form a closed system describing the transmission dynamics involving contact tracing. We define and calculate basic and effective reproduction numbers in terms of pathogen characteristics and contact tracing implementation constraints. When applied to the case of SARS-CoV-2, our results show that only combinations of diagnosis of symptomatic infections and contact tracing that are almost perfect in terms of speed and coverage can attain control, unless additional measures to reduce overall community transmission are in place. Under constraints on the testing or tracing capacity, a temporary interruption of contact tracing may, depending on the overall growth rate and prevalence of the infection, lead to an irreversible loss of control even when the epidemic was previously contained.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>In response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the Hospital Pharmacy Services have  quickly adapted to respond to a critical situation characterized by the constant  and continuous admission of patients with severe pneumonia who needed  treatment, requiring a transformation of the hospital in order to increase the  number of hospital and critical beds. Moreover, other out-ofhospital spaces have  been transformed into hospitalization units to absorb the large number of  patients that had to be treated and isolated. To guarantee the distribution of  medicines and the quality of the pharmaceutical care, drug distribution systems,  such as unit dose and automated dispensing systems, have undergone  transformations. Standard stocks were assigned for COVID units, and different  dispensing circuits to avoid the risk of cross-contamination between COVID and  non-COVID units were created, as well as disinfection protocols for medication  transport systems and medication return protocols. All this without forgetting  COVID treatment protocol's changes that were affected by the availability of the  drugs. The increase in the number of beds in out-of-hospital spaces, such as  field hospitals, hotels, socio-medical centers and nursing homes, has challenged  Pharmacy Services, since new medication dispensing and conciliation circuits  have been created forcing the increase of pharmacy staff's presence and  modifying work shifts, to afford all the new tasks successfully. Development of  contingency plans for the different Pharmacy Service activities and providing  fluent communication channels are key elements for crisis situations or health  emergencies such as the current pandemic.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has rapidly spread across the world since its first emergence in China in late 2019. It is a major public health concern with no effective treatct 3ments. The immunopathology of SARS-CoV-2 is associated with an excessive inflammatory response. Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is also associated with the severity of the disease in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Neopterin is a macrophage activation marker produced by monocytes and macrophages upon activation by interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). Neopterin is a well-established marker in a variety of diseases, and recent evidence indicates that it could be helpful in early prediction of the severity of COVID-19 disease and serve as a prognostic marker. Here, we outline the role of macrophage activation syndrome in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and suggest that neopterin could be used as a biomarker for progression of COVID-19.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"">Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has now been confirmed worldwide. Yet, COVID-19 is strangely and tragically selective. Morbidity and mortality due to COVID19 rise dramatically with age and co-existing health conditions, including cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Human genetic factors may contribute to the extremely high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 and to the relentlessly progressive disease observed in a small but significant proportion of infected individuals, but these factors are largely unknown.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""MAIN BODY"">In this study, we investigated genetic susceptibility to COVID-19 by examining DNA polymorphisms in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (two key host factors of SARS-CoV-2) from ~ 81,000 human genomes. We found unique genetic susceptibility across different populations in ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Specifically, ACE2 polymorphisms were found to be associated with cardiovascular and pulmonary conditions by altering the angiotensinogen-ACE2 interactions, such as p.Arg514Gly in the African/African-American population. Unique but prevalent polymorphisms (including p.Val160Met (rs12329760), an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL)) in TMPRSS2, offer potential explanations for differential genetic susceptibility to COVID-19 as well as for risk factors, including those with cancer and the high-risk group of male patients. We further discussed that polymorphisms in ACE2 or TMPRSS2 could guide effective treatments (i.e., hydroxychloroquine and camostat) for COVID-19.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">This study suggested that ACE2 or TMPRSS2 DNA polymorphisms were likely associated with genetic susceptibility of COVID-19, which calls for a human genetics initiative for fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.</AbstractText>

Ethical considerations.,"Sven Ove Hansson, Gert Helgesson, Niklas Juth","<Abstract><AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"">In the initial phase of the Covid-19 pandemic, difficult decisions had to be made on the allocation of testing resources. Similar situations can arise in future pandemics. Therefore, careful consideration of who should be tested is an important part of pandemic preparedness. We focus on four ethical aspects of that problem: how to prioritize scarce testing resources, the regulation of commercial direct-to-consumer test services, testing of unauthorized immigrants, and obligatory testing.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""MAIN TEXT"">The distribution of scarce resources for testing: We emphasize the use of needs-based criteria, but also acknowledge the importance of choosing a testing strategy that contributes efficiently to stopping the overall spread of the disease. Commercial direct-to-consumer test services: Except in cases of acute scarcity, such services will in practice have to be allowed. We propose that they should be subject to regulation that ensures test quality and adequate information to users. Testing of unauthorized immigrants, their children and other people with unclear legal status: Like everyone else, these individuals may be in need of testing, and it is in society's interest to reach them with testing in order to stop the spread of the disease. A society that offers comprehensive medical services to unauthorized immigrants is in a much better position to reach them in a pandemic than a society that previously excluded them from healthcare. Obligatory testing: While there are often strong reasons for universal testing in residential areas or on workplaces, there are in most cases better ways to achieve testing coverage than to make testing mandatory.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">In summary, we propose (1) decision-making primarily based on needs-based criteria, (2) strict regulation but not prohibition of direct-to-consumer test services, (3) test services offered to unauthorized immigrants, preferably as part of comprehensive medical services, and (4) broad outreach of testing services whenever possible, but in general not obligatory testing.</AbstractText></Abstract>",0,2021-07-28 00:00:00

                <AbstractText>Despite success with eliminating the COVID-19 pandemic in Aotearoa New Zealand (at least to early August 2020), the response to the pandemic threat has resulted in a range of negative social and economic impacts, including job losses. Understanding the health consequences of these impacts will be increasingly important in the 'recovery' phase. This article contributes to this understanding by exploring the relationship between unemployment and cardiovascular disease (CVD)-a major contributor to health loss in Aotearoa New Zealand. We reviewed the literature about the impact of unemployment on CVD. The totality of the evidence suggested that increased unemployment arising from economic shocks is associated with increased CVD incidence, particularly for middle-aged men. Continued monitoring and active policy responses are required to prevent increases in CVD (and other health outcomes) as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic response. For example, quantifying the CVD-related health loss from pandemic-associated unemployment, along with the health costs and impact on health inequalities, could help with government decision-making to reduce CVD burdens. This could be via intensifying tobacco control, regulating the food supply (eg, to reduce salt/sodium levels), and improving uptake of CVD preventive medications such as statins and anti-hypertensives.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">In a retrospective single-center analysis at the University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland, we investigated 31 adult COVID-19 patients between April 6th and May 13th, 2020 and with at least one laboratory assessment of the coagulation markers prothrombin time/Quick, thrombin time, fibrinogen and D-dimers. For antithrombotic prophylaxis low-molecular-weight-heparin or unfractionated heparin was administered and two patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia received argatroban.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">We analyzed 31 patients (68% male, mean age 60± SD 15 years). 22 (71%) of these required intensive care unit treatment, 5 (16%) were hospitalized in a ward, and 4 (13%) were outpatients. Mean fibrinogen levels were markedly elevated to 6.4± SD 1.8g/l, with a peak in the third week of the disease and no significant decrease over time. D-dimers were elevated to a mean value of 5.1±4.4mg/l with peak levels of 6.8±5.3mg/l in the fourth week of disease, and a subsequent decrease. Platelet count (308±136G/l) and PT/Quick (85±22%) showed no significant changes over time. Sensitivity analyses for patients treated in the ICU showed that D-dimer levels were higher in this group. The results of other sensitivity analyses were comparable. Thromboembolic events were diagnosed in 4 (13%) patients and 5 (16%) patients died during the observation period.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>The consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy have not been well defined. However, there have been a number of reports of poor maternal and fetal outcomes worldwide. This report presents a case of stillbirth with associated placental pathology during week 35 in an otherwise healthy pregnant woman with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Placental findings in this case showed patchy acute chorionitis and diffuse infarction/villous necrosis of the placental parenchyma resulting in extensive vascular malperfusion. Fetal autopsy was most significant for placental findings and no congenital malformations were discovered. The findings in this case are consistent with reports in the literature of pathological placental changes associated with COVID-19. This case of fetal demise in a woman with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection without any other medical or obstetric disorders and no alternate cause suggests that fetal death can be an outcome of COVID-19 during pregnancy. This outcome was supported by the histopathological findings in the placenta. Continued research is imperative to confirm the findings in this case and multiple similar cases. Additionally, increased screening and collection of COVID-19 data specific to pregnant women and their fetuses and infants is needed to increase knowledge, support research efforts, and create guidelines for clinical practice that will prevent potential negative outcomes and loss of life.</AbstractText>

COVID-19 has many different clinical manifestations. One of them is arterial hypercoagulopathy. Although its mechanism is not fully explained, acute thrombosis and thromboembolism can be seen in patients. In this study, we present a case who was amputated due to the development of arterial thrombosis on the 10th day following infection with coronavirus, despite successful replantation after traumatic above-elbow amputation. After replantation on the seventh day, it was learned that the patient's husband was positive for COVID-19 and had come to visit the patient. For this reason, we performed reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to confirm the patient's COVID-19 status. We found that the patient, who was asymptomatic, was positive by RT-PCR for COVID-19. On the 10th day after the operation, it was observed that the blood circulation of the replanted extremity was impaired, although it had been perfect until that day. Emergency embolectomy and vascular reanastomosis were planned for the patient. Although we generally observe thrombosis at an end-to-end anastomosis site, massive axillary arterial thrombosis was detected at the proximal end of the vascular anastomosis. Upon development of tachycardia, hypotension, and metabolic acidosis after embolectomy and vascular reanastomosis, the decision was made to amputate the replanted limb to reduce the risk of life-threatening complications. To our knowledge, this is the first such COVID-19-related complication on upper extremity replantation in the literature.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2021, Günay et al.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>",0,2021-06-01 00:00:00

In this paper, we present an immunothrombosis model of COVID-19. We discuss the underlying pathogenesis and the interaction between multiple systems, resulting in propagation of immunothrombosis, which through investigation in the coming weeks, may lead to both an improved understanding of COVID-19 pathophysiology and identification of innovative and efficient therapeutic targets to reverse the otherwise unfavorable clinical outcome of many of these patients.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>In this paper, we present a new approach to deterministic modelling of COVID-19 epidemic. Our model dynamics is expressed by a single prognostic variable which satisfies an integro-differential equation. All unknown parameters are described with a single, time-dependent variable <i>R</i>(<i>t</i>). We show that our model has similarities to classic compartmental models, such as SIR, and that the variable <i>R</i>(<i>t</i>) can be interpreted as a generalized effective reproduction number. The advantages of our approach are the simplicity of having only one equation, the numerical stability due to an integral formulation and the reliability since the model is formulated in terms of the most trustable statistical data variable: the number of cumulative diagnosed positive cases of COVID-19. Once this dynamic variable is calculated, other non-dynamic variables, such as the number of heavy cases (hospital beds), the number of intensive-care cases (ICUs) and the fatalities, can be derived from it using a similarly stable, integral approach. The formulation with a single equation allows us to calculate from real data the values of the sample effective reproduction number, which can then be fitted. Extrapolated values of <i>R</i>(<i>t</i>) can be used in the model to make reliable forecasts, though under the assumption that measures for reducing infections are maintained. We have applied our model to more than 15 countries and the ongoing results are available on a web-based platform [1]. In this paper, we focus on the data for two exemplary countries, Italy and Germany, and show that the model is capable of reproducing the course of the epidemic in the past and forecasting its course for a period of four to five weeks with a reasonable numerical stability.</AbstractText>

After an initial explosive outbreak of pneumonia of unknown etiology in China, the disease spread first to neighboring Asian countries and then worldwide. Patients with COVID-19 presented with a constellation of symptoms such as fever, dry cough, dyspnea, sore throat, and nasal congestion and radiological findings showed bilateral lung glassy opacities. Vitamin D has many mechanisms by which it reduces the risk of microbial infection and death, including physical barrier, cellular natural immunity, and adaptive immunity. Vitamin D supplementation has shown favorable effects in viral infections including influenza and HIV. The effects of vitamin D supplementation during covid 19 infection remain controversial. Looking ahead, clinical studies are needed to define better cut offs for vitamin D levels and, finally, which dosage is the best.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"">In 2013, California passed Senate Bill 493, which allowed pharmacists to furnish hormonal contraceptives without a physician's prescription. Despite this expanded scope of practice, only 11% of the pharmacies reported furnishing hormonal contraception over the following 6 years.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""OBJECTIVES"">Our study objectives were to determine the extent of hormonal contraceptive furnishing and identify the factors that led to successful implementation in San Francisco community pharmacies.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">Backspace we conducted a cross-sectional survey to identify community pharmacies furnishing hormonal contraception in San Francisco. Interviews were coded inductively to identify consistent themes. Semistructured interviews with pharmacists at the locations that furnished contraception identified the factors that had led to successful implementation in local community pharmacies, as well as assessing changes in practice during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">San Francisco had 113 operational community pharmacies in April 2020. Of these, 21 locations reported that they furnished hormonal contraception (19%), and we interviewed pharmacists at 12 of those locations. We identified 3 key factors that drove implementation at the pharmacy level: administrative support, advertising, and pharmacist engagement. Additional drivers of implementation involved the nature of the community. The respondents also reported on barriers that continued to slow adoption, including consultation fees, time constraints, and patient privacy. Changes in demand for services owing to COVID-19 risks were inconsistent.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">Our findings suggest strategies that community pharmacies can use to expand their scope of practice and improve quality and continuity of care for patients.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Oral inhalation is the preferred route for delivery of small molecules to the lungs, because high tissue levels can be achieved shortly after application. Biologics are mainly administered by intravenous injection but inhalation might be beneficial for the treatment of lung diseases (e.g. asthma). This review discusses biological and pharmaceutical challenges for delivery of biologics and describes promising candidates. Insufficient stability of the proteins during aerosolization and the biological environment of the lung are the main obstacles for pulmonary delivery of biologics. Novel nebulizers will improve delivery by inducing less shear stress and administration as dry powder appears suitable for delivery of biologics. Other promising strategies include pegylation and development of antibody fragments, while carrier-encapsulated systems currently play no major role in pulmonary delivery of biologics for lung disease. While development of various biologics has been halted or has shown little effects, AIR DNase, alpha1-proteinase inhibitor, recombinant neuraminidase, and heparin are currently being evaluated in phase III trials. Several biologics are being tested for the treatment of coronavirus disease (COVID)-19, and it is expected that these trials will lead to improvements in pulmonary delivery of biologics.</AbstractText>

Patients with migraine were specifically vulnerable to inadequate medical care. We aimed to investigate the ""real-world"" impact of COVID-19 pandemic on migraine patients, and to identify risk factors for poor outcome.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">We administered an online, self-reported survey that included demographic, migraine-related, COVID-19-specific and overall psychosocial variables between July 15 and July 30, 2020. We recruited a sample of patients with migraine from headache clinic registry and via social media to complete an anonymous survey. Outcomes included demographic variables, change in migraine frequency and severity during the lockdown period, communication with treating physician, compliance to migraine treatment, difficulty in getting medications, medication overuse, symptoms of anxiety and/or depression, sleep and eating habits disturbance, screen time exposure, work during pandemic, use of traditional medicine, effect of Botox injection cancellation, and overall worries and concerns during pandemic.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">A total of 1018 patients completed the survey. Of the respondents, 859 (84.3%) were females; 733 (71.9%) were aged 20 to 40 years, 630 (61.8%) were married, and 466 (45.7%) reported working during the pandemic. In comparison to pre-pandemic period, 607 respondents (59.6%) reported increase in migraine frequency, 163 (16%) reported decrease in frequency, and 105 (10.3%) transformed to chronic migraine. Severity was reported to increase by 653 (64.1%) respondents. The majority of respondents; 626 (61.5%) did not communicate with their neurologists, 477 (46.9%) reported compliance to treatment, and 597 (58.7%) reported overuse of analgesics. Botox injections cancellation had a negative impact on 150 respondents (66.1%) from those receiving it. Forty-one respondents (4%) were infected with COVID-19; 26 (63.4%) reported worsening of their headaches amid infection period. Sleep disturbance was reported by 794 (78.1%) of respondents, and 809 (79.5%) reported having symptoms of anxiety and/or depression.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publishes COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) guidance for specific institutional audiences to limit community spread. Audiences include: business, clinical, public health, education, community, and state/local government. The swift, severe, and global nature of COVID-19 offers an opportunity to systematically obtain a national view of how larger institutions of higher education adopted NPI guidance at the onset of the pandemic.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""METHOD"">An original database of COVID-19-related university NPI policy changes was compiled. Survey team members manually combed university websites and official statements capturing implementation decisions and dates for five NPI variables from 575 U.S. universities, across 50 states and the District of Columbia, during March of 2020. The universities included in this study were selected from the Department of Education Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), which provides a set of university explanatory variables. Using IPEDS as the basis for the organizational data allows consistent mapping to event-time and institutional characteristic variables including public health announcements, geospatial, census, and political affiliation.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">The dataset enables event-time analysis and offers a variety of variables to support institutional level study and identification of underlying biases like educational attainment. A descriptive analysis of the dataset reveals that there was substantial heterogeneity in the decisions that were made and the timing of these decisions as they temporally related to key state, national, and global emergency announcements. The WHO pandemic declaration coincided with the largest number of university decisions to implement NPIs.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">This study provides descriptive observations and produced an original dataset that will be useful for future research focused on drivers and trends of COVID-19 NPIs for U.S. Universities. This preliminary analysis suggests COVID-19 university decisions appeared to be made largely at the university level, leading to major variations in the nature and timing of the responses both between and within states, which requires further study.</AbstractText>

Despite scientific progress, true infection severity, factoring both diagnosed and undiagnosed infections, remains poorly understood. This study aimed to estimate SARS-CoV-2 age-stratified and overall morbidity and mortality rates based on analysis of extensive epidemiological data for the pervasive epidemic in Qatar, a country where &lt; 9% of the population are ≥ 50 years. We show that SARS-CoV-2 severity and fatality demonstrate a striking age dependence with low values for those aged &lt; 50 years, but rapidly growing rates for those ≥ 50 years. Age dependence was particularly pronounced for infection criticality rate and infection fatality rate. With Qatar's young population, overall SARS-CoV-2 severity and fatality were not high with &lt; 4 infections in every 1000 being severe or critical and &lt; 2 in every 10,000 being fatal. Only 13 infections in every 1000 received any hospitalization in acute-care-unit beds and &lt; 2 in every 1000 were hospitalized in intensive-care-unit beds. However, we show that these rates would have been much higher if Qatar's population had the demographic structure of Europe or the United States.

                <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"">In Japan, the latest estimates of excess all-cause deaths through January to July 2020 showed that the overall (direct and indirect) mortality burden from the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Japan was relatively low compared to Europe and the United States. However, consistency between the reported number of COVID-19 deaths and excess all-cause deaths was limited across prefectures, suggesting the necessity of distinguishing the direct and indirect consequences of COVID-19 by cause-specific analysis. To examine whether deaths from road injuries decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan, consistent with a possible reduction of road transport activity connected to Japan's state of emergency declaration, we estimated the exiguous deaths from road injuries in each week from January to September 2020 by 47 prefectures.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">To estimate the expected weekly number of deaths from road injuries, a quasi-Poisson regression was applied to daily traffic fatalities data obtained from Traffic Accident Research and Data Analysis, Japan. We set two thresholds, point estimate and lower bound of the two-sided 95% prediction interval, for exiguous deaths, and report the range of differences between the observed number of deaths and each of these thresholds as exiguous deaths.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">Since January 2020, in a few weeks the observed deaths from road injuries fell below the 95% lower bound, such as April 6-12 (exiguous deaths 5-21, percent deficit 2.82-38.14), May 4-10 (8-23, 21.05-43.01), July 20-26 (12-29, 30.77-51.53), and August 3-9 (3-20, 7.32-34.41). However, those less than the 95% lower bound were also observed in weeks in the previous years.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">The number of road traffic fatalities during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan has decreased slightly, but not significantly, in several weeks compared with the average year. This suggests that the relatively small changes in excess all-cause mortality observed in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic could not be explained simply by an offsetting reduction in traffic deaths. Considering a variety of other indirect effects, evaluating an independent, unbiased measure of COVID-19-related mortality burden could provide insight into the design of future broad-based infectious disease counter-measures and offer lessons to other countries.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Surveillance data obtained by public health agencies for COVID-19 are likely inaccurate due to undercounting and misdiagnosing. Using a Bayesian approach, we sought to reduce bias in the estimates of prevalence of COVID-19 in Philadelphia, PA at the ZIP code level. After evaluating various modeling approaches in a simulation study, we estimated true prevalence by ZIP code with and without conditioning on an area deprivation index (ADI). As of June 10, 2020, in Philadelphia, the observed citywide period prevalence was 1.5%. After accounting for bias in the surveillance data, the median posterior citywide true prevalence was 2.3% when accounting for ADI and 2.1% when not. Overall the median posterior surveillance sensitivity and specificity from the models were similar, about 60% and more than 99%, respectively. Surveillance of COVID-19 in Philadelphia tends to understate discrepancies in burden for the more affected areas, potentially misinforming mitigation priorities.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>We present a case of late initiation of remdesivir antiviral therapy in the successful treatment of a patient with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a mixed medical intensive care unit of a community teaching hospital. A previously healthy 40-year-old man was admitted to the hospital 3 days after the onset of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms including dry cough, fever, and shortness of breath progressing to intubation and increased mechanical ventilator support. A request for compassionate use remdesivir was submitted on the same hospital day as the positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction result. Supportive measures, in addition to a 5-day course of hydroxychloroquine, were maintained until remdesivir could be supplied on day 9 of hospitalization, 13 days after symptom onset. Sixty hours after initiating remdesivir, the patient was successfully extubated and able to transition to room air within 24 hours of extubation. Late initiation of remdesivir may be effective in treating SARS-CoV-2, unlike antivirals utilized for different disease states, such as oseltamivir, that are most effective when started as soon as possible following symptom onset. Urgent action is needed by regulatory agencies to work with drug manufacturers to expedite the study and approval of investigational agents targeting SARS-CoV-2 as well as to meet manufacturing demands.</AbstractText>

The objective of this study was to assess modifying effects of demographic factors on COVID-19 testing status and outcomes in a large, diverse single health system cohort. The Mount Sinai Health System de-identified COVID-19 database contained records of 39,539 patients entering the health system from 02/28/2020 to 06/08/2020 with 7,032 laboratory-confirmed cases. The prevalence of qRT-PCR nasopharyngeal swabs (χ2 = 665.7, p&lt;0.0001) and case rates (χ2 = 445.3, p&lt;0.0001) are highest in Hispanics and Black or African Americans. The likelihood of admission and/or presentation to an intensive care unit (ICU) versus non-ICU inpatient unit, emergency department, and outpatient services, which reflects the severity of the clinical course, was also modified by race and ethnicity. Females were less likely to be tested [Relative Risk(RR) = 1.121, p&lt;0.0001], and males had a higher case prevalence (RR = 1.224, p&lt;0.001). Compared to other major ethnic groups, Whites experienced a higher prevalence of mortality (p&lt;0.05). Males experienced a higher risk of mortality (RR = 1.180, p = 0.0012) at relatively younger ages (70.58±11.75) compared to females (73.02±11.46) (p = 0.0004). There was an increased severity of disease in older patient populations of both sexes. Although Hispanic and Black or African American race was associated with higher testing prevalence and positive testing rates, the only disparity with respect to mortality was a higher prevalence in Whites.</AbstractText></Abstract>",0,2021-07-30 00:00:00

                <AbstractText>Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the cellular receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that is causing the serious coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic. Here, we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of full-length human ACE2 in the presence of the neutral amino acid transporter B<sup>0</sup>AT1 with or without the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the surface spike glycoprotein (S protein) of SARS-CoV-2, both at an overall resolution of 2.9 angstroms, with a local resolution of 3.5 angstroms at the ACE2-RBD interface. The ACE2-B<sup>0</sup>AT1 complex is assembled as a dimer of heterodimers, with the collectrin-like domain of ACE2 mediating homodimerization. The RBD is recognized by the extracellular peptidase domain of ACE2 mainly through polar residues. These findings provide important insights into the molecular basis for coronavirus recognition and infection.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>In the modern era of personalized and precision medicine, lung cancer management needs to be carried out in a multidisciplinary manner. Among other disciplines, also cytopathology is key in diagnosis and treatment management of these patients. Indeed, cytopathology specimens are often the only source of available tissue material for morphological diagnosis and molecular purposes in order to guarantee an adequate treatment decision making, since surgical resection specimens are not available when lung cancer is diagnosed at advanced disease stages. Today, as an effect of the current severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, cytopathology is reorganizing and reshaping many of its procedures and workflows, in order to ensure the safety of cytopathologists and laboratory personnel. In particular, careful attention should be paid on biosafety procedures when pulmonary cytological specimens are handled. In addition, also molecular cytopathology, that provides relevant information on the molecular status and on the potential sensitivity to target treatments, is undergoing major changes. In this setting, fully automated technologies, requiring minimal hands-on work, may be a valid option. The aim of this narrative review is to keep updated all the different professional figures involved in lung cancer management and treatment on how SARS-CoV-2 is modifying lung cancer cytopathology.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Newborns are highly susceptible to infectious diseases. The underlying mechanism of neonatal infection susceptibility has generally been related to their under-developed immune system. Nevertheless, this notion has recently been challenged by the discovery of the physiological abundance of immunosuppressive erythroid precursors <b>C</b>D71<sup>+</sup><b>e</b>rythroid <b>c</b>ell<b>s</b> (CECs) in newborn mice and human cord blood. Here, as proof of concept, we show that these cells are also abundant in the peripheral blood of human newborns. Although their frequency appears to be more variable compared to their counterparts in mice, they rapidly decline by 4 weeks of age. However, their proportion remains significantly higher in infants up to six months of age compared to older infants. We found CD45 expressing CECs, as erythroid progenitors, were the prominent source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in both humans and mice. Interestingly, a higher proportion of CD45<sup>+</sup>CECs was observed in the spleen versus bone marrow of neonatal mice, which was associated with a higher ROS production by splenic CECs compared to their siblings in the bone marrow. CECs from human newborns suppressed cytokine production by CD14 monocytes and T cells, which was partially abrogated by apocynin <i>in vitro</i>. Moreover, the depletion of CECs in neonatal mice increased the number of activated effector immune cells in their spleen and liver, which rendered them more resistant to <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i> infection. This was evident by a significant reduction in the bacteria load in the spleen, liver and brain of treated-mice compared to the control group, which enhanced their survival rate. Our finding highlights the immunoregulatory processes mediated by CECs in newborns. Thus, such tightly regulated immune system in newborns/infants may explain one potential mechanism for the asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 infection in this population.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has dramatically changed our habits and routines. Uncertainty, insecurity, instability for the present and future, and reduced autonomy and self-directedness, are common feelings at the time of COVID-19. These aspects are very important during emerging adulthood. In spite of the fact that medical reports suggest that youth are less prone to experience COVID-19 infections, emerging adults might be at higher risk for their psychological adjustment. Emerging adults showed higher concerns about their role as a possible asymptomatic carrier than being positive with COVID-19 themselves. Both worries and concerns about COVID-19 and psychological maladjustment may be related to cultural factors. Individualism, collectivism, equality, and hierarchy seem to be meaningful perspectives to take into account. A total of 1183 Italian emerging adults were asked to fill out an online survey during the second week of the national lockdown in Italy. Results showed they reported an accurate perceived knowledge about COVID-19. At the same time, they showed higher worries and concerns about COVID-19 for their relatives, followed by more general/social worries. The lowest score included worries about COVID-19 related to themselves. State anxiety and stress levels were above the normal cutoff, confirming the challenges that emerging adults are facing during the pandemic. On one hand, emerging adults' collectivistic orientation was related to higher perceived risks of infection; on the other hand, it predicted lower psychological maladjustment, controlling for socio-demographic variables. The study suggests that to fight the COVID-19 pandemic and decrease levels of psychological maladjustment in emerging adulthood, individuals' cultural orientation such as the wish of sharing common goals with others, interdependence, and sociability, have to be emphasized and promoted as protective factors.</AbstractText>

Development assistance is an important source of health financing in many low-income countries, yet little is known about how much of this funding was disbursed for COVID-19. We aimed to put development assistance for health for COVID-19 in the context of broader trends in global health financing, and to estimate total health spending from 1995 to 2050 and development assistance for COVID-19 in 2020.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">We estimated domestic health spending and development assistance for health to generate total health-sector spending estimates for 204 countries and territories. We leveraged data from the WHO Global Health Expenditure Database to produce estimates of domestic health spending. To generate estimates for development assistance for health, we relied on project-level disbursement data from the major international development agencies' online databases and annual financial statements and reports for information on income sources. To adjust our estimates for 2020 to include disbursements related to COVID-19, we extracted project data on commitments and disbursements from a broader set of databases (because not all of the data sources used to estimate the historical series extend to 2020), including the UN Office of Humanitarian Assistance Financial Tracking Service and the International Aid Transparency Initiative. We reported all the historic and future spending estimates in inflation-adjusted 2020 US$, 2020 US$ per capita, purchasing-power parity-adjusted US$ per capita, and as a proportion of gross domestic product. We used various models to generate future health spending to 2050.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""FINDINGS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">In 2019, health spending globally reached $8·8 trillion (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 8·7-8·8) or $1132 (1119-1143) per person. Spending on health varied within and across income groups and geographical regions. Of this total, $40·4 billion (0·5%, 95% UI 0·5-0·5) was development assistance for health provided to low-income and middle-income countries, which made up 24·6% (UI 24·0-25·1) of total spending in low-income countries. We estimate that $54·8 billion in development assistance for health was disbursed in 2020. Of this, $13·7 billion was targeted toward the COVID-19 health response. $12·3 billion was newly committed and $1·4 billion was repurposed from existing health projects. $3·1 billion (22·4%) of the funds focused on country-level coordination and $2·4 billion (17·9%) was for supply chain and logistics. Only $714·4 million (7·7%) of COVID-19 development assistance for health went to Latin America, despite this region reporting 34·3% of total recorded COVID-19 deaths in low-income or middle-income countries in 2020. Spending on health is expected to rise to $1519 (1448-1591) per person in 2050, although spending across countries is expected to remain varied.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""INTERPRETATION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Global health spending is expected to continue to grow, but remain unequally distributed between countries.

                <AbstractText>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic presents several dermatological manifestations described in the present indexed literature, with around 700 cases reported until May 2020, some described as urticaria or urticarial rashes. Urticaria is constituted by evanescent erythematous-edematous lesions (wheals and flare), which does not persist in the same site for more than 24 to 48 hours and appears in other topographic localization, resolving without residual hyper pigmentation. During the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, some cytokines are synthesized, including Interferon (IFN) type I, TNF-α, and chemokines which may induce mast cells (MCs) and basophils degranulation by mechanisms similar to the autoinflammatory monogenic or polygenic diseases. In this article, we discuss the spectrum of the urticaria and urticarial-like lesions in the COVID-19's era, besides other aspects related to innate and adaptative immune response to viral infections, interactions between dermal dendritic cells and MCs, and degranulation of MCs by different stimuli. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells share, in allergic patients, expression of the high-affinity IgE receptors on cell membranes and demonstrated a low pattern of type I IFN secretion in viral infections. We discuss the previous descriptions of the effects of omalizumab, a monoclonal antibody directed to IgE and high-affinity IgE receptors, to improve the IFN responses and enhance their antiviral effects.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>It is not yet entirely clear what is the relevance of skin symptoms and what clinical implications are related to their appearance in COVID-19 patients. We describe two cases of COVID-19-associated pneumonia, which presented skin manifestations in advanced stage of illness, when nasopharyngeal swabs became negative for SARS-CoV-2. The first case presented erythematous, maculopapular lesions; the second developed petechial, vesicular and blood-encrusted lesions on the limbs. Histopathology documented perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates, with prevalent CD4+ T-cells in both patients. The research of SARS-CoV-2 in tissues with real time RT-PCR was negative. Basal keratinocytes displayed C4d deposits in one case, who developed laboratory signs indicative of a procoagulative condition at the same time as the skin rash. Skin manifestations during SARS-CoV-2 infection seem to be clinically relevant and further studies are necessary to assess if they are linked to systemic complications, lack of viral clearance or cascades of immune responses induced by the virus, even in patients affected by mild pneumonia.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>This article provides a perspective on the reciprocal relationships between public and private sector resilience planning activities and the ongoing COVID responses in the U.S. Through the lens of the built environment, this article provides selected insights into how various disaster, organizational, and engineering resilience activities have likely positively shaped COVID responses within the healthcare sector. These positive influences are contextualized within extensive efforts within public health and healthcare management to calibrate community resilience frameworks and practices for utilization in everything from advancing community health to the continuity of facilities operations. Thereafter, the article shifts focus to speculate on how ongoing experiences under COVID might yield positive impacts for future resilience designs, plans and policies within housing and the built environment. Through this perspective, the article hopes to explore those often overlooked aspects of the physical and social parameters of the built environment that may be understood as providing opportunities to inform future disaster, public health, and climate change preparations and responses.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Infection with SARS-CoV-2 represents a great source of concern and a new threat for immunocompromised patients. Limited studies are available on COVID-19 in immunocompromised children. This case series aimed to evaluate the clinical and laboratory characteristics, management and outcomes of COVID-19 in five children immunocompromised due to different underlying conditions. All had mild symptoms or were asymptomatic at presentation. All had a benign course of illness. No changes or delays in their treatment regimens occurred, and none experienced a relapse of the original disease, developed severe COVID-19 or died. However, these cases showed a prolonged duration of virus shedding. This report suggests that immunocompromised paediatric patients may not be at a higher risk of developing severe COVID-19. However, further studies are required to elaborate on the pathogenesis of COVID-19 in this vulnerable group.</AbstractText>

Herein, we performed phenome-wide association study, tissue and immune-cell-specific expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL)/splicing quantitative trait locus, and colocalization analyses for genetic risk loci suggestively associated with severe COVID-19 with respiratory failure. Thirteen phenotypes/traits were associated with the severe COVID-19-associated loci at the genome-wide significance threshold, including monocyte counts, fat metabolism traits, and fibrotic idiopathic interstitial pneumonia. In addition, we identified tissue and immune subtype-specific eQTL associations affecting 48 genes, including several ones that may directly impact host immune responses, colocalized with the severe COVID-19 genome-wide association study associations, and showed altered expression in single-cell transcriptomes. Collectively, our work demonstrates that host genetic variations associated with multiple genes and traits show genetic pleiotropy with severe COVID-19 and may inform disease etiology.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>© 2021 The Authors.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>",1,2021-06-04 00:00:00

This study aims to estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Saint Petersburg, Russia accounting for non-response bias. A sample of adults was recruited with random digit dialling, interviewed and invited for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The seroprevalence was corrected with the aid of the bivariate probit model that jointly estimated individual propensity to agree to participate in the survey and seropositivity. 66,250 individuals were contacted, 6,440 adults agreed to be interviewed and blood samples were obtained from 1,038 participants between May 27 and June 26, 2020. Naïve seroprevalence corrected for test characteristics was 9.0% (7.2-10.8) by CMIA and 10.5% (8.6-12.4) by ELISA. Correction for non-response decreased estimates to 7.4% (5.7-9.2) and 9.1% (7.2-10.9) for CMIA and ELISA, respectively. The most pronounced decrease in bias-corrected seroprevalence was attributed to the history of any illnesses in the past 3 months and COVID-19 testing. Seroconversion was negatively associated with smoking status, self-reported history of allergies and changes in hand-washing habits. These results suggest that even low estimates of seroprevalence can be an overestimation. Serosurvey design should attempt to identify characteristics that are associated both with participation and seropositivity.</AbstractText></Abstract>",2,2021-07-07 00:00:00

                <AbstractText>The coronavirus pandemic, known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is an infectious respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus first identified in patients from Wuhan, China. Since December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has spread swiftly around the world, infected more than 25 million people, and caused more than 800,000 deaths in 188 countries. Chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) appear to be risk factors for COVID-19, however, their prevalence remains controversial. In fact, studies in China reported lower rates of chronic respiratory conditions in patients with COVID-19 than in the general population, while the trend is reversed in the United States and Europe. Although the underlying molecular mechanisms of a possible interaction between COVID-19 and chronic respiratory diseases remain unknown, some observations can help to elucidate them. Indeed, physiological changes, immune response, or medications used against SARS-CoV-2 may have a greater impact on patients with chronic respiratory conditions already debilitated by chronic inflammation, dyspnea, and the use of immunosuppressant drugs like corticosteroids. In this review, we discuss importance and the impact of COVID-19 on asthma and COPD patients, the possible available treatments, and patient management during the pandemic.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"">Various techniques are employed in order to support contact tracing, which has been shown to be highly effective against the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To apply the technology, either the quarantine authorities should provide the location history COVID-19 patients, or all people should provide their own location history. This inevitably makes people either the patient location history or personal location history of the public, leading to the privacy protection issue of information release for the public good against privacy exposure risks.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText><b>Introduction:</b> During a pandemic, protective measures to prevent bio-aerosol based infections, such as Corona Virus Infection Disease 19 (COVID 19), are very important. Everyday face masks can only partially block aerosols, and their effectiveness also depend on how well the person is wearing it. They are recommended for classroom situations during high pandemic activity. However, 'unprotected' communication with and among children is fundamental from the pedagogical and psychological point of view for normal psychosocial development and teaching. Partition walls around the persons can theoretically provide substantial standardized mechanical protection against the spread of droplets and aerosols, either as additional protection to face masks or as an alternative. <b>Methods:</b> In the present research, the protection effectiveness of partition walls was investigated. With mannequin heads, fog generators, line lasers and a classroom-like setup with protective walls, flow visualization and aerosol concentration measurements were performed. Additionally, an active fan-suction system was tested to remove the channelled aerosols on top of the partition walls before they reach other persons in the room. <b>Results:</b> It was found that partition walls protect neighbours from bio-aerosol contact regardless of whether they wear masks or not. The combination with standardized room ventilation enforces this effect. Moreover, the experiments performed here clearly showed that partition walls may protect neighbours from bio-aerosols better than suboptimally fitting everyday face masks only. <b>Conclusion:</b> Partition walls are the most effective protection against infectious bio-aerosols in classroom settings and should be combined with standardized ventilation as the preferred method for classrooms during the current COVID 19 pandemic.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic requires significant changes to standard operating procedures for non-COVID-19 related illnesses. Balancing the benefit from standard evidence-based treatments with the risks posed by COVID-19 to patients, healthcare workers and to the population at large is difficult due to incomplete and rapidly changing information. In this article, we use management of acute coronary syndromes as a case study to show how these competing risks and benefits can be resolved, albeit incompletely. While the risks due to COVID-19 in patients with acute coronary syndromes is unclear, the benefits of standard management are well established in this condition. As an aid to decision making, we recommend systematic estimation of the risks and benefits for management of any condition where there is likely to be an increase in non-COVID-19 related mortality and morbidity due to changes in routine care.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>The rapid emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented and poses an unparalleled obstacle in the sixty-five year history of organ transplantation. Worldwide, the delivery of transplant care is severely challenged by matters concerning - but not limited to - organ procurement, risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, screening strategies of donors and recipients, decisions to postpone or proceed with transplantation, the attributable risk of immunosuppression for COVID-19 and entrenched health care resources and capacity. The transplant community is faced with choosing a lesser of two evils: initiating immunosuppression and potentially accepting detrimental outcome when transplant recipients develop COVID-19 versus postponing transplantation and accepting associated waitlist mortality. Notably, prioritization of health care services for COVID-19 care raises concerns about allocation of resources to deliver care for transplant patients who might otherwise have excellent 1-year and 10-year survival rates. Children and young adults with end-stage organ disease in particular seem more disadvantaged by withholding transplantation because of capacity issues than from medical consequences of SARS-CoV-2. This report details the nationwide response of the Dutch transplant community to these issues and the immediate consequences for transplant activity. Worrisome, there was a significant decrease in organ donation numbers affecting all organ transplant services. In addition, there was a detrimental effect on transplantation numbers in children with end-organ failure. Ongoing efforts focus on mitigation of not only primary but also secondary harm of the pandemic and to find right definitions and momentum to restore the transplant programs.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>A key tenet of protection from infection for dentists is to know who is not infectious. The evidence base regarding protection from respiratory pathogens in dentistry is poor. Those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody are non-infectious (&gt;99% certainty) and can be safely treated with good universal precautions, even for aerosol generating procedures. Viral infectivity with SARS-CoV-2 lasts eight days, unlike viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) swab tests which can persist for as long as seven weeks. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody becomes detectable from 11 days after infection. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies are usually neutralising against the virus and their direct antiviral activity was partially demonstrated in 33,000 patients with COVID-19 treated with convalescent plasma in the USA. So, a positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody is a much more accurate determination of infectiousness than a repeat PCR which is only 70% sensitive. It remains to be seen whether SARS-Cov-2 vaccine responses include protective IgG titres and, once vaccines become widespread, can be used to assist decision-making on appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) in dentistry.</AbstractText>

Even though SARS-CoV-2 is rarely detected in the central nervous system (CNS) or cerebrospinal fluid, evidence is accumulating that SARS-CoV-2 might enter the CNS via the olfactory nerve. However, what happens after SARS-CoV-2 enters the CNS is poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated the replication kinetics, cell tropism, and associated immune responses of SARS-CoV-2 infection in different types of neural cultures derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). SARS-CoV-2 was compared to the neurotropic and highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza A virus. SARS-CoV-2 infected a minority of individual mature neurons, without subsequent virus replication and spread, despite angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), and neuropilin-1 (NPR1) expression in all cultures. However, this sparse infection did result in the production of type III interferons and interleukin-8 (IL-8). In contrast, H5N1 virus replicated and spread very efficiently in all cell types in all cultures. Taken together, our findings support the hypothesis that neurological complications might result from local immune responses triggered by virus invasion, rather than abundant SARS-CoV-2 replication in the CNS. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Infections with the recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are often associated with neurological complications. Evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 enters the brain via the olfactory nerve; however, SARS-CoV-2 is only rarely detected in the central nervous system of COVID-19 patients. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to infect neurons of human iPSC neural cultures but that this infection is abortive and does not result in virus spread to other cells. However, infection of neural cultures did result in the production of type III interferon and IL-8. This study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 might enter the CNS and infect individual neurons, triggering local immune responses that could contribute to the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2-associated CNS disease.</AbstractText></Abstract>",1,2021-07-24 00:00:00

                <AbstractText>For several decades there has been accumulating evidence implicating type I interferons (IFNs) as key elements of the immune response. Therapeutic approaches incorporating different recombinant type I IFN proteins have been successfully employed to treat a diverse group of diseases with significant and positive outcomes. The biological activities of type I IFNs are consequences of signaling events occurring in the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells. Biochemical events involving JAK/STAT proteins that control transcriptional activation of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) were the first to be identified and are referred to as ""canonical"" signaling. Subsequent identification of JAK/STAT-independent signaling pathways, critical for ISG transcription and/or mRNA translation, are denoted as ""non-canonical"" or ""non-classical"" pathways. In this review, we summarize these signaling cascades and discuss recent developments in the field, specifically as they relate to the biological and clinical implications of engagement of both canonical and non-canonical pathways.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>This study aims to explore the psychological impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-related lockdown in university workers, and to analyse the factors related to their levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. A cross-sectional study was conducted between 8-22 April 2020, 3.5 weeks after the COVID-19-related lockdown in Spain. We collected sociodemographic and occupational data, in addition to housing, work and health conditions. Coping strategies (Brief COPE-28); level of anxiety, stress, and depression (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales DASS-21); perception of the disease (COVID-19) (Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire BIPQ); and perceived level of social support (Escala Multidimensional de Apoyo Social EMAS) were measured. Multiple linear regression models were fitted to explore the factors related to the level of anxiety, depression, and stress. The sample included 677 subjects. Higher scores in depression, anxiety, and stress occurred among females, younger subjects, administration and service workers; and subjects with a smaller home, as well as those with worse health status, worse quality of sleep, and dysfunctional coping strategies. The COVID-19-related lockdown had a great impact on the mental health of university workers. The participants with specific sociodemographic and occupational characteristics, clinical disorders, and dysfunctional coping strategies were more at risk.</AbstractText>

More importantly, after the craniotomy, the patient had high fever and it was difficult to retreat. After cerebrospinal fluid testing, it was determined that an intracranial infection had occurred. After anti-infection and plasma infusion of the recovered person, the patient's symptoms gradually improved.

                <AbstractText>We made the first and successful attempt to detect SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in the vicinity wastewaters of an isolation centre i.e. Shaheed Bhulu Stadium, situated at Noakhali, Southeastern Bangladesh. Owing to the fact that isolation centre, in general, always contained a constant number of 200 COVID-19 patients, the prime objective of the study was to check if several drains carrying RNA of coronavirus are actually getting diluted or accumulated along with the sewage network. Our finding suggested that while the temporal variation of the genetic load decreased in small drains over the span of 50 days, the main sewer exhibited accumulation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Other interesting finding displays that probably distance of sampling location in meters is not likely to have a significant impact on the detected gene concentration, although the quantity of the RNA extracted in the downstream of the drain was higher. These findings are of immense value from the perspective of wastewater surveillance of COVID-19, as they largely imply that we do not need to monitor every wastewater system, and probably major drains monitoring may illustrate the city health. Perhaps, we are reporting the accumulation of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material along with the sewer network i.e. from primary to tertiary drains. The study sought further data collection in this line to simulate conditions prevailed in most of the developing countries and to shed further light on decay/accumulation processes of the genetic load of the SARS-COV-2.</AbstractText>

It has been suggested that women are at a higher risk for mood alterations, but most of the studies are cross-sectional or have only considered the first days of the confinement in their longitudinal designs. The present study was aimed at evaluating temporal changes in anxiety and depression in a general sample of 155 non-infected adult Spanish women after a complete quarantine. It also explored the predictive role of personality, the establishment of new routines and physical activity during lockdown in a pre-post design assessing temporal and clinical mood changes after 5 weeks of lockdown. Logistic regression analyses showed that higher neuroticism and depressive levels at baseline, lower routines engagement, and lower physical activity during lockdown predicted depression caseness, whereas anxiety caseness was best predicted by higher neuroticism, more days of lockdown and greater anxiety symptoms at baseline. It is concluded that lockdown duration, increased neuroticism and baseline levels of anxiety and depression are risk factors for women's mental health, while routines and physical activity emerge as protective factors for managing psychological wellbeing during the pandemic lockdowns.</AbstractText></Abstract>",0,2021-08-09 00:00:00

                <AbstractText Label=""PURPOSE"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the well-being of healthcare workers to varying degrees. The aim of the current study was to investigate how the pandemic has affected the burnout, stress, and emotional well-being of pediatric hematology oncology (PHO) providers and staff in the New York and New Jersey epicenter.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">The study was conducted in June 2020 during the pandemic through an electronic survey. The survey contained questions surrounding demographics, pandemic experiences, and validated burnout, stress, and emotional well-being measures.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">Two hundred fifty-two PHO providers and staff responded to the survey. Overall, half of the participants reported high levels of burnout, average stress scores were in the mild-moderate range, and the majority scored in the none-to-mild symptomatology range for their well-being. Self-reported burnout levels before the pandemic and geographic work location were statistically significant risk factors for all outcomes. Additional predictors for some outcomes included hospital role, lack of trust in leadership, and deployment. The majority of participants (87.0%) reported that their hospitals had made mental health resources related to COVID-19 available to them but only 8.4% reported having used them.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">PHO providers and staff in the NYC/NJ area are experiencing a range of emotional experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the majority are not using current resources. With the continuation of the pandemic, we must continue efforts to improve provider and staff distress to mitigate the degree of potential negative short-term and long-term impact.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>The social and economic crisis induced by Covid-19 in low- and middle-income countries could be long, deep, and pervasive, especially when viewed through the lens of migrant workers. Migrant workers in India tend to live and work in megacities in crowded conditions that do not permit social distancing, putting them at an increased risk of contracting the disease. Migrant workers here face challenges accessing health care even in normal circumstances due to lack of health insurance, cost, administrative hurdles, lack of public health infrastructure, and lack of access to these facilities. The sudden lockdown due to Covid left lakhs of migrant workers in India stranded and on the road, having lost jobs and being left without income, food, and accommodation. Lakhs attempted to travel back home on foot only to be shuttled into shelters and relief camps hastily cobbled up as a last-minute response to the migrant crisis. This article analyzes the specific ways in which Indian migrant workers have been affected by the pandemic and examines the response of the government and its impact in mitigating and addressing the crisis. By doing so, it aims to provide insights for more comprehensive, inclusive, and effective migrant policies and operations involving multiple stakeholders at all levels.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Inspired by the self-assembly approach, in this work, the chromogen, 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), was successfully co-precipitated in aqueous solution to form collective nanoparticles (NPs) of signal molecules (TMB-NPs). Utilizing poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) in the molecular delivery approach, the formed emulsion nanovesicle (TMB-NPs@PLGA) exhibits an enrichment of the collective signal molecules in a single antibody-antigen conjugation. A specific antibody-conjugated TMB-NPs@PLGA forms an immunocomplex sandwich structure upon the addition of influenza virus (IV)/A. The addition of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) dissolves the PLGA nanovesicles, releasing the encapsulated TMB-NPs. Sequentially, the TMB-NPs release TMB molecules upon the addition of DMSO. The released TMB is catalytically oxidized by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> with self-assembled protein-inorganic nanoflowers, where copper nanoflowers (CuNFs) acted as the nanozyme. The developed immunoassay demonstrates high sensitivity for IV/A with a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 32.37 fg mL<sup>-1</sup> and 54.97 fg mL<sup>-1</sup> in buffer and serum, respectively. For practical needs, a clinically isolated IV/A/H3N2 and spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 were detected with the LODs of 17 pfu mL<sup>-1</sup> and 143 fg mL<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. These results show the applicability of the advanced TMB-NPs@PLGA-based colorimetric sensor for the highly sensitive detection of airborne respiratory viruses.</AbstractText>

What happens when physicians are forced to make therapeutic decisions under uncertainty? The absence of scientific guidelines at the beginning of a pandemic due to an unknown virus, such as COVID-19, could influence the perceived legitimacy of the application of non-evidence-based therapeutic approaches. This paper reports on a test of this hypothesis, in which we administered an ad hoc questionnaire to a sample of 64 Italian physicians during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy (April 2020). The questionnaire statements regarding the legitimacy of off-label or experimental drugs were framed according to three different scenarios (Normality, Emergency and COVID-19). Furthermore, as the perception of internal bodily sensations (i.e., interoception) modulates the decision-making process, we tested participants' interoceptive sensibility using the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA). The results showed that participants were more inclined to legitimate non-evidence-based therapeutic approaches in the COVID-19 and Emergency scenarios than the Normality scenario. We also found that scores on the MAIA Trusting subscale positively predicted this difference. Our findings demonstrate that uncertain medical scenarios, involving a dramatic increase in patient volume and acuity, can increase risk-taking in therapeutic decision-making. Furthermore, individual characteristics of health care providers, such as interoceptive ability, should be taken into account when constructing models to prevent the breakdown of healthcare systems in cases of severe emergency.</AbstractText></Abstract>",0,2021-09-08 00:00:00

                <AbstractText>Fibrinolysis is an important process in hemostasis responsible for dissolving the clot during wound healing. Plasmin is a central enzyme in this process via its capacity to cleave fibrin. The kinetics of plasmin generation (PG) and inhibition during fibrinolysis have been poorly understood until the recent development of assays to quantify these metrics. The assessment of plasmin kinetics allows for the identification of fibrinolytic dysfunction and better understanding of the relationships between abnormal fibrin dissolution and disease pathogenesis. Additionally, direct measurement of the inhibition of PG by antifibrinolytic medications, such as tranexamic acid, can be a useful tool to assess the risks and effectiveness of antifibrinolytic therapy in hemorrhagic diseases. This review provides an overview of available PG assays to directly measure the kinetics of plasmin formation and inhibition in human and mouse plasmas and focuses on their applications in defining the role of plasmin in diseases, including angioedema, hemophilia, rare bleeding disorders, COVID-19, or diet-induced obesity. Moreover, this review introduces the PG assay as a promising clinical and research method to monitor antifibrinolytic medications and screen for genetic or acquired fibrinolytic disorders.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"">Air pollution exposure and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) cause a poor prognosis after SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the underlying mechanisms are not well explored. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) are the keys to the entry of SARS-CoV-2. We therefore hypothesized that air pollution exposure and IPF may increase the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the lung alveolar region. We measured their expression levels in lung tissues of control non-IPF and IPF patients, and used murine animal models to study the deterioration of IPF caused by particulate matter (PM) and the molecular pathways involved in the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">In non-IPF patients, cells expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were limited to human alveolar cells. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were largely upregulated in IPF patients, and were co-expressed by fibroblast specific protein 1 (FSP-1) + lung fibroblasts in human pulmonary fibrotic tissue. In animal models, PM exposure increased the severity of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were also expressed in FSP-1+ lung fibroblasts in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, and when combined with PM exposure, they were further upregulated. The severity of pulmonary fibrosis and the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 caused by PM exposure were blocked by deletion of KC, a murine homologue of IL-8, or treatment with reparixin, an inhibitor of IL-8 receptors CXCR1/2.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">These data suggested that risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease severity increased by air pollution exposure and underlying IPF. It can be mediated through upregulating ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in pulmonary fibroblasts, and prevented by blocking the IL-8/CXCR1/2 pathway.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Evidence is mounting to indicate that cancer patients may have more likelihood of having coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) but lack consistency. A robust estimate is urgently needed to convey appropriate information to the society and the public, in the time of ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis through a comprehensive literature search in major databases in English and Chinese, and two investigators conducted publication selection and data extraction independently. A meta-analysis was used to obtain estimates of pooled prevalence of cancer in patients with COVID-19 and determine the association of cancer with severe events, after assessment of potential heterogeneity, publication bias, and correction for the estimates when necessary. Total 38 studies comprising 7094 patients with COVID-9 were included; the pooled prevalence of cancer was estimated at 2.3% (95% confidence limit [CL] [0.018, 0.029]; P &lt; .001) overall and 3.2% (95% CL [0.023, 0.041]; P &lt; .001) in Hubei province; the corresponding estimates were 1.4% and 1.9% after correction for publication bias; cancer was significantly associated with the events of severe cases (odds ratio [OR] = 2.20, 95% CL [1.53, 3.17]; P &lt; .001) and death (OR = 2.97, 95% CL [1.48, 5.96]; P = .002) in patients with COVID-19, there was no significant heterogeneity and a minimal publication bias.

                <AbstractText>A new SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) belonging to the genus Betacoronavirus has caused a pandemic known as COVID-19. Among coronaviruses, the main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>) is an essential drug target which, along with papain-like proteases catalyzes the processing of polyproteins translated from viral RNA and recognizes specific cleavage sites. There are no human proteases with similar cleavage specificity and therefore, inhibitors are highly likely to be nontoxic. Therefore, targeting the SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> enzyme with small molecules can block viral replication. The present study is aimed at the identification of promising lead molecules for SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> enzyme through virtual screening of antiviral compounds from plants. The binding affinity of selected small drug-like molecules to SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup>, SARS-CoV M<sup>pro</sup> and MERS-CoV M<sup>pro</sup> were studied using molecular docking. Bonducellpin D was identified as the best lead molecule which shows higher binding affinity (-9.28 kcal/mol) as compared to the control (-8.24 kcal/mol). The molecular binding was stabilized through four hydrogen bonds with Glu166 and Thr190 as well as hydrophobic interactions via eight residues. The SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> shows identities of 96.08% and 50.65% to that of SARS-CoV M<sup>pro</sup> and MERS-CoV M<sup>pro</sup> respectively at the sequence level. At the structural level, the root mean square deviation (RMSD) between SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> and SARS-CoV M<sup>pro</sup> was found to be 0.517 Å and 0.817 Å between SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> and MERS-CoV M<sup>pro</sup>. Bonducellpin D exhibited broad-spectrum inhibition potential against SARS-CoV M<sup>pro</sup> and MERS-CoV M<sup>pro</sup> and therefore is a promising drug candidate, which needs further validations through in vitro and in vivo studies.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>In this brief report, we describe the safety of reopening US Olympic and Paralympic Training facilities (USOPTFs) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic from July 2020 through October 2020. We evaluated the prevalence of COVID-19 infection at the time of reentry and cardiopulmonary sequelae of COVID-19 in elite athletes. All athletes returning to a USOPTF were required to go through a reentry protocol consisting of an electronic health history, a 6-day quarantine including twice-daily symptom surveys, COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction and antibody testing, physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, and pulmonary function testing. Athletes with current or prior COVID-19 infection also underwent an echocardiogram, cardiology consultation, and additional testing as indicated. All athletes followed rigorous infection prevention measures and minimized contact with the outside community following reentry. At the time of this report, 301 athletes completed the reentry protocol among which 14 (4.7%) tested positive for active (positive polymerase chain reaction test, n = 3) or prior (positive antibody test, n = 11) COVID-19 infection. During the study period, this cohort accrued 14,916 days living and training at USOPTFs. Only one (0.3%) athlete was subsequently diagnosed with a new COVID-19 infection. No cardiopulmonary pathology attributable to COVID-19 was detected. Our findings suggest that residential elite athlete training facilities can successfully resume activity during the COVID-19 pandemic when strict reentry and infection prevention measures are followed. Dissemination of our reentry quarantine and screening protocols with COVID-19 mitigation measures may assist the global sports and medical community develop best practices for reopening of similar training centers.</AbstractText>

This study evaluates the association between work hours, work-family balance and quality of life (QoL) among teachers during the Chilean health emergency of the COVID-19 pandemic. Teachers from across Chile were contacted via email and social media to answer an online survey. QoL was evaluated via the SF-36 questionnaire, work hours and work-family balance in the pandemic. A total of 336 teachers from across Chile participated in this study. Teachers had a low QoL score, associated with age (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Teachers who were ≤44 showed lower deterioration risks in the Physical Component Summary (OR: 0.54) than the ≥45-year-old age group; simultaneously, the younger group (≤44 years) had a greater risk (OR: 2.46) of deterioration in the Mental Component Summary than teachers over 45 years. A total of 78.7% of teachers reported having increased their work hours during the COVID-19 pandemic due to teleworking and 86% indicated negative effects on their work-family balance. Pandemic work hours and negative work-family balance increase the risk of reducing the Mental Component Summary (OR: 1.902; OR: 3.996, respectively).

                <AbstractText>Background Radiologists are proficient in differentiating between chest radiographs with and without symptoms of pneumonia but have found it more challenging to differentiate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia from non-COVID-19 pneumonia on chest radiographs. Purpose To develop an artificial intelligence algorithm to differentiate COVID-19 pneumonia from other causes of abnormalities at chest radiography. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, a deep neural network, CV19-Net, was trained, validated, and tested on chest radiographs in patients with and without COVID-19 pneumonia. For the chest radiographs positive for COVID-19, patients with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction results positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 with findings positive for pneumonia between February 1, 2020, and May 30, 2020, were included. For the non-COVID-19 chest radiographs, patients with pneumonia who underwent chest radiography between October 1, 2019, and December 31, 2019, were included. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity were calculated to characterize diagnostic performance. To benchmark the performance of CV19-Net, a randomly sampled test data set composed of 500 chest radiographs in 500 patients was evaluated by the CV19-Net and three experienced thoracic radiologists. Results A total of 2060 patients (5806 chest radiographs; mean age, 62 years ± 16 [standard deviation]; 1059 men) with COVID-19 pneumonia and 3148 patients (5300 chest radiographs; mean age, 64 years ± 18; 1578 men) with non-COVID-19 pneumonia were included and split into training and validation and test data sets. For the test set, CV19-Net achieved an AUC of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.91, 0.93). This corresponded to a sensitivity of 88% (95% CI: 87, 89) and a specificity of 79% (95% CI: 77, 80) by using a high-sensitivity operating threshold, or a sensitivity of 78% (95% CI: 77, 79) and a specificity of 89% (95% CI: 88, 90) by using a high-specificity operating threshold. For the 500 sampled chest radiographs, CV19-Net achieved an AUC of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.96) compared with an AUC of 0.85 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.88) achieved by radiologists. Conclusion CV19-Net was able to differentiate coronavirus disease 2019-related pneumonia from other types of pneumonia, with performance exceeding that of experienced thoracic radiologists. © RSNA, 2021 <i>Online supplemental material is available for this article.</i></AbstractText>

In this article we summarize present knowledge regarding transmission from mother to the fetus/newborn. Although both vertical and horizontal transmission are rare, SARS-CoV-2 positivity is associated with an increased risk of premature delivery and higher neonatal mortality and morbidity. Mode of delivery and cord clamping routines should not be affected by the mother's SARS-CoV-2 status. Skin to skin contact, rooming in and breastfeeding are recommended with necessary hygiene precautions.

A rapid and reliable clinical evaluation of disease intensity will assist in the allocation and prioritization of mortality mitigation resources. The novelty of the work proposed in this paper is an early prediction model of high mortality risk for both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients, which provides state-of-the-art performance, in an external validation cohort from a different population. Retrospective research was performed on two separate hospital datasets from two different countries for model development and validation. In the first dataset, COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients were admitted to the emergency department in Boston (24 March 2020 to 30 April 2020), and in the second dataset, 375 COVID-19 patients were admitted to Tongji Hospital in China (10 January 2020 to 18 February 2020). The key parameters to predict the risk of mortality for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients were identified and a nomogram-based scoring technique was developed using the top-ranked five parameters. Age, Lymphocyte count, D-dimer, CRP, and Creatinine (ALDCC), information acquired at hospital admission, were identified by the logistic regression model as the primary predictors of hospital death. For the development cohort, and internal and external validation cohorts, the area under the curves (AUCs) were 0.987, 0.999, and 0.992, respectively. All the patients are categorized into three groups using ALDCC score and death probability: Low (probability &lt; 5%), Moderate (5% &lt; probability &lt; 50%), and High (probability &gt; 50%) risk groups. The prognostic model, nomogram, and ALDCC score will be able to assist in the early identification of both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients with high mortality risk, helping physicians to improve patient management.</AbstractText></Abstract>",0,2021-09-28 00:00:00

                <AbstractText>Deprescribing aims to reduce polypharmacy, especially in the elderly population, in order to maintain or improve quality of life, reduce harm from medications, and limit healthcare expenditure. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that has led to a pandemic and has changed the lives many throughout the world. The mode of transmission of this virus is from person to person through the transfer of respiratory droplets. Therefore, non-essential healthcare services involving direct patient interactions, including deprescribing, has been on hiatus to reduce spread. Barriers to deprescribing before the pandemic include patient and system related factors, such as resistance to change, patient's knowledge deficit about deprescribing, lack of alternatives for treatment of disease, uncoordinated delivery of health services, prescriber's attitudes and/or experience, limited availability of guidelines for deprescribing, and lack of evidence on preventative therapy. Some of these barriers can be mitigated by using the following interventions:patient education, prioritization of non-pharmacological therapy, incorporation of electronic health record (EHR), continuous prescriber education, and development of research studies on deprescribing. Currently, deprescribing cannot be delivered through in person interactions, so virtual care is a reasonable alternative format. The full incorporation of EHR throughout Canada can add to the success of this strategy. However, there are several challenges of conducting deprescribing virtually in the elderly population. These challenges include, but are not limited, to their inability to use technology, lack of literacy, lack of assistance from others, greater propensity for withdrawal effects, and increased risk of severe consequences, if hospitalized. Virtual care is the future of healthcare and in order to retain the benefits of deprescribing, additional initiatives should be in place to address the challenges that elderly patients may experience in accessing deprescribing virtually. These initiatives should involve teaching elderly patients how to use technology to access health services and with technical support in place to address any concerns.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>After the 1918 flu pandemic, the world is again facing a similar situation. However, the advancement in medical science has made it possible to identify that the novel infectious agent is from the coronavirus family. Rapid genome sequencing by various groups helped in identifying the structure and function of the virus, its immunogenicity in diverse populations, and potential preventive measures. Coronavirus attacks the respiratory system, causing pneumonia and lymphopenia in infected individuals. Viral components like spike and nucleocapsid proteins trigger an immune response in the host to eliminate the virus. These viral antigens can be either recognized by the B cells or presented by MHC complexes to the T cells, resulting in antibody production, increased cytokine secretion, and cytolytic activity in the acute phase of infection. Genetic polymorphism in MHC enables it to present some of the T cell epitopes very well over the other MHC alleles. The association of MHC alleles and its downregulated expression has been correlated with disease severity against influenza and coronaviruses. Studies have reported that infected individuals can, after recovery, induce strong protective responses by generating a memory T-cell pool against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. These memory T cells were not persistent in the long term and, upon reactivation, caused local damage due to cross-reactivity. So far, the reports suggest that SARS-CoV-2, which is highly contagious, shows related symptoms in three different stages and develops an exhaustive T-cell pool at higher loads of viral infection. As there are no specific treatments available for this novel coronavirus, numerous small molecular drugs that are being used for the treatment of diseases like SARS, MERS, HIV, ebola, malaria, and tuberculosis are being given to COVID-19 patients, and clinical trials for many such drugs have already begun. A classical immunotherapy of convalescent plasma transfusion from recovered patients has also been initiated for the neutralization of viremia in terminally ill COVID-19 patients. Due to the limitations of plasma transfusion, researchers are now focusing on developing neutralizing antibodies against virus particles along with immuno-modulation of cytokines like IL-6, Type I interferons (IFNs), and TNF-α that could help in combating the infection. This review highlights the similarities of the coronaviruses that caused SARS and MERS to the novel SARS-CoV-2 in relation to their pathogenicity and immunogenicity and also focuses on various treatment strategies that could be employed for curing COVID-19.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by a new coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is spreading around the world. However, a universally effective treatment regimen has not been developed to date. The main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>), a key enzyme of SARS-CoV-2, plays a crucial role in the replication and transcription of this virus in cells and has become the ideal target for rational antiviral drug design. In this study, we performed molecular dynamics simulations three times for these complexes of M<sup>pro</sup> (monomeric and dimeric) and nine potential drugs that have a certain effect on the treatment of COVID-19 to explore their binding mechanism. In addition, a total of 12 methods for calculating binding free energy were employed to determine the optimal drug. Ritonavir, Arbidol, and Chloroquine consistently showed an outstanding binding ability to monomeric M<sup>pro</sup> under various methods. Ritonavir, Arbidol, and Saquinavir presented the best performance when binding to a dimer, which was independent of the protonated state of Hie41 (protonated at N<sub>ε</sub>) and Hid41 (protonated at N<sub>δ</sub>), and these findings suggest that Chloroquine may not effectively inhibit the activity of dimeric M<sup>pro</sup>in vivo. Furthermore, three common hot-spot residues of Met165, Hie41, and Gln189 of monomeric M<sup>pro</sup> systems dominated the binding of Ritonavir, Arbidol, and Chloroquine. In dimeric M<sup>pro</sup>, Gln189, Met165, and Met49 contributed significantly to binding with Ritonavir, Arbidol, and Saquinavir; therefore, Gln189 and Met165 might serve as the focus in the discovery and development of anti-COVID-19 drugs. In addition, the van der Waals interaction played a significant role in the binding process, and the benzene ring of the drugs showed an apparent inhibitory effect on the normal function of M<sup>pro</sup>. The binding cavity had great flexibility to accommodate these different drugs. The results would be notably helpful for enabling a detailed understanding of the binding mechanisms for these important drug-M<sup>pro</sup> interactions and provide valuable guidance for the design of potent inhibitors.</AbstractText>

Resurgences of COVID-19 have also been observed in many other countries. In Guangzhou, China, a small outbreak, involving less than 100 residents, emerged in March and April 2020, and comprehensive and near-real-time genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 was conducted. When the numbers of confirmed cases among overseas travelers increased, public health measures were enhanced by shifting from self-quarantine to central quarantine and SARS-CoV-2 testing for all overseas travelers. In an analysis of 109 imported cases, we found diverse viral variants distributed in the global viral phylogeny, which were frequently shared within households but not among passengers on the same flight. In contrast to the viral diversity of imported cases, local transmission was predominately attributed to two specific variants imported from Africa, including local cases that reported no direct or indirect contact with imported cases. The introduction events of the virus were identified or deduced before the enhanced measures were taken. These results show the interventions were effective in containing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and they rule out the possibility of cryptic transmission of viral variants from the first wave in January and February 2020. Our study provides evidence and emphasizes the importance of controls for overseas travelers in the context of the pandemic and exemplifies how viral genomic data can facilitate COVID-19 surveillance and inform public health mitigation strategies.</AbstractText></Abstract>",1,2021-07-22 00:00:00

                <AbstractText>Pathology training programs throughout the United States have endured unprecedented challenges dealing with the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. At Houston Methodist Hospital, the Department of Pathology and Genomic Medicine planned and executed a trainee-oriented, stepwise emergency response. The focus was on optimizing workflows among areas of both clinical and anatomic pathology, maintaining an excellent educational experience, and minimizing trainee exposure to coronavirus disease 2019. During the first phase of the response, trainees were divided into 2 groups: one working on-site and the other working remotely. With the progression of the pandemic, all trainees were called back on-site and further redeployed within our department to meet the significantly increased workload demands of our clinical laboratory services. Adjustments to trainee educational activities included, among others, the organization of a daily coronavirus disease 2019 virtual seminar series. This series served to facilitate communication between faculty, laboratory managers, and trainees. Moreover, it became a forum for trainees to provide updates on individual service workflows and volumes, ongoing projects and research, as well as literature reviews on coronavirus disease 2019-related topics. From our program's experience, redeploying pathology trainees within our department during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic resulted in optimization of patient care while ensuring trainee safety, and importantly, helped to maintain continuous high-quality education through active involvement in unique learning opportunities.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>The psycho-social day-to-day experience of COVID-19 pandemic has shone some light on the wider scope of health vulnerability and has correspondingly enlarged the ethical debate surrounding the social implications of health and healthcare. This emerging paradigm is neither a single-handed problem of biomedical scientists nor of social analysts. It instead needs a strategically oriented collaborative and interdisciplinary preventive effort. To that effect, this article presents some socio-ethical reflections underscoring the judicious use of the insight from care ethics as an asset in minimizing the possible propagation of the COVID-19 virus and the escalation of its vulnerability in the day-to-day human interaction. It further emphasizes that if this insight is overlooked, the effects of the diverse facets of the ""shadow pandemics"" of COVID-19-fallouts on both the affected and the infected-may equally be deadly.</AbstractText>

Thus, it is crucial to measure the public risk perception about COVID-19 and its influence on the evacuation decision. This study explores the nexus between COVID-19 risk perception and coastal peoples' evacuation decisions during cyclone Amphan. With an analysis of 378 sample households survey data of the Satkhira district, this study developed the COVID-19 risk perception index using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and categorized the respondents based on the score. The result shows that 1.85 %, 21.43 %, 45.77 %, 25.13 %, and 5.82 % have very low, low, moderate, high, and very high-risk perceptions, respectively. The analysis also reveals that 96.6 % of the respondents received an evacuation order during Amphan, but only 42 % complied with the order. The t-test analysis and common language effect size test of the survey data reveal that the respondents with a high perception score are 65 % less likely to evacuate than the respondents with low perception scores. This study has important implications in guiding concerned authorities to combat natural disasters during COVID-19 and other similar public health emergencies in the future.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>© 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>",0,2021-08-10 00:00:00

Preliminary data suggest a not insignificant prevalence of cardiac involvement. Here, we report our early experience with COVID-19 in the pediatric population. These patients display exceptionally high levels of acute-phase reactants. The clinical syndrome in these patients is somewhat similar to Kawasaki disease with or without myocardial involvement. In some cases, the presentation mimics typical myocarditis. Severe myocardial involvement is associated with transient electrocardiographic and echocardiographic abnormalities. These findings may be due to the cardiotropic nature of the virus or may be the result of an immunologic response to the infection.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label=""Background"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">The trail of the transmission of COVID-19 in Africa needs to be understood and conceptualized. With the limited response time to curb the transmission, the pandemic is already in 52 countries in Africa. There is much anxiety about the devastating potential of this scourge in Africa, justifiably so because of the weak health systems, high levels of poverty, and overcrowded cities. Therefore, this report examined the association between the confirmed cases at 100 days of COVID-19 and some significant risk factors in 19 African countries that had at least 100 confirmed cases as of 09 April 2020.</AbstractText>

We demonstrate that the S1-Fc fusion protein is extremely immunogenic, as evidenced by strong antibody titers observed by day 7. Strong virus neutralizing activity was observed on day 14 in rabbits immunized with the S1-Fc fusion protein using a pseudovirus neutralization assay. Most importantly, in &lt;20 days and three injections of the S1-Fc fusion protein, two monkeys developed higher virus neutralizing titers than a recovered COVID-19 patient in a live SARS-CoV-2 infection assay.

Communicating with patients or their families during such dire times is very important especially when the patient or family members have unrealistic expectations. Herein, we have highlighted practical suggestions which if applied can prevent unnecessary draining encounters with patients and families; for example, incorporating ancillary staff such as palliative and pastoral care into the care team. We have also proposed a new concept of 'physician optimism'. Based on this concept, the physician can be classified as a pessimist or an optimist with realistic or unrealistic expectations and communicate to patients with or without requisite empathy. To ensure the best outcomes, we conclude that physicians must be realistic optimists who always communicate with empathy.

                <AbstractText>During the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, many schools quickly transitioned their teaching and assessment strategies to online formats. In Spring 2020, a 3-station remote Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) was implemented for first-year pharmacy students. The day following the remote OSCEs students answered three open-text prompts about the remote OSCE experience: (1) ""I liked..."", (2) ""I learned…"", and (3) ""I suggest…"". Responses were open-coded and frequency counts were calculated to determine the most prevalent codes. Concept maps were created to visualize and explore connections between the codes. Out of 157 students, 156 students completed the reflection assignment, a 99.36% response rate. The three major themes in the Liked data were: Logistics (<i>n</i> = 65, 41.7%), Differences In-person Versus Remote (<i>n</i> = 59, 37.8%), and Skill Development (<i>n</i> = 43, 27.6%).

                <AbstractText>The World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) as a pandemic on March 11, 2020 (WHO). Within a couple of days, all Canadian provinces announced the implementation of social distancing measures. We evaluated the immediate effect of COVID-19 on psychiatric emergency and inpatient services in Canada's largest psychiatric hospital in the first month of the pandemic. We extracted data from the electronic medical records of the Center for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto, Canada. We compared emergency department visits, inpatient occupancy rates, and length of stay in March 2019 and March 2020, and during the first and second half of March 2020. There was a decrease in the number of emergency department visits and inpatient occupancy rates in March 2020 compared to March 2019. There was also a significant decrease in the number of emergency department visits and inpatient occupancy rates in the second half of March 2020 compared to the first half. Our findings suggest that the pandemic was followed by a rapid decrease in the usage of psychiatric emergency and inpatient services in a large mental health hospital. Future studies will need to assess whether this decrease will be followed by a return to baseline or an increase in need for these services.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>The world is confronted by the current pandemic of Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19), which is a wake-up call for all nations irrespective of their development status or geographical location. Since the start of the century we have seen five big infectious outbreaks which proved that epidemics are no more regarded as historic and geographically confined threats. The Canadian government underlined that these infectious disease outbreaks are threats to global health security and disrupt societal wellbeing and development. In this context, the Public Health Agency of Canada is proactive and has shown its preparedness for outbreaks of emerging and epidemic-prone diseases, and in dealing with these pathogens. Even before the declaration of pandemic, Canada has proved its global health leadership by ensuring collective action and multisectoral coordination which still remains a serious challenge especially for low and middle- income countries with existing poor health systems. In this article we discuss how Canada is addressing the global challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic through its leadership and practice of global health diplomacy.</AbstractText>

On the basis of the physical activity rating scale, health values scale, subjective well-being scale, and the satisfaction with life scale, we collected 505 valid questionnaires online from 31 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in China. A series of multiple linear regression models were established to study the relationship between variables, and the bootstrap confidence interval was selected to test the mediating effect. The results showed that during the period of isolation, physical activity directly (b = 0.463, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) or indirectly (b = 0.358, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) had a positive impact on residents' well-being through the mediating effect of health values. There was a positive correlation between physical activity and health values (b = 0.710, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), while health values had a direct positive association on well-being (b = 0.504, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). In addition, a moderate amount of physical activity was found to be more associated with the well-being of residents during home isolation compared to small and large amounts of physical activity. This study shows the importance of residents' physical activities in home isolation. Moderate exercise at home and regular physical activity are beneficial to our physical and mental health, especially in terms of improving overall well-being.</AbstractText></Abstract>",0,2021-07-27 00:00:00

                <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"">The liability of patients affected by novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) to develop venous thromboembolic events is widely acknowledged. However, many particulars of the interactions between the two diseases are still unknown. This study aims to outline the main characteristics of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) in COVID-19 patients, based on the experience of four high-volume COVID-19 hospitals in Northern Italy.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">All cases of COVID-19 in-hospital patients undergoing duplex ultrasound (DUS) for clinically suspected DVT between March 1st and April 25th, 2020, were reviewed. Demographics and clinical data of all patients with confirmed DVT were recorded. Computed tomography pulmonary angiographies of the same population were also examined looking for signs of PE.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">Of 101 DUS performed, 42 were positive for DVT, 7 for superficial thrombophlebitis, and 24 for PE, 8 of which associated with a DVT. Most had a moderate (43.9%) or mild (16.9%) pneumonia. All venous districts were involved. Time of onset varied greatly, but diagnosis was more frequent in the first two weeks since in-hospital acceptance (73.8%). Most PEs involved the most distal pulmonary vessels, and two-thirds occurred in absence of a recognizable DVT.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">DVT, thrombophlebitis, and PE are different aspects of COVID-19 procoagulant activity and they can arise regardless of severity of respiratory impairment. All venous districts can be involved, including the pulmonary arteries, where the high number and distribution of the thrombotic lesions without signs of DVT could hint a primitive thrombosis rather than embolism.</AbstractText>

Median (interquartile range) TTI by cancer was 32 (21-48) days for breast, 79 (55-117) days for prostate, 41 (27-62) days for NSCLC, and 26 (16-40) days for colon. Across all cancers, a general increase in the 5-year and 10-year predicted mortality was associated with increasing TTI. The most pronounced mortality association was for colon cancer (eg, 5 y predicted mortality, stage III: TTI 61-120 d, 38.9% vs. 181-365 d, 47.8%), followed by stage I NSCLC (5 y predicted mortality: TTI 61-120 d, 47.4% vs 181-365 d, 47.6%), while survival for prostate cancer was least associated (eg, 5 y predicted mortality, high risk: TTI 61-120 d, 12.8% vs 181-365 d, 14.1%), followed by breast cancer (eg, 5 y predicted mortality, stage I: TTI 61-120 d, 11.0% vs. 181-365 d, 15.2%). A nonsignificant difference in treatment delays and worsened survival was observed for stage II lung cancer patients-who had the highest all-cause mortality for any TTI regardless of treatment timing.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>SARS-CoV2 infection or COVID-19 has created panic around the world since its first origin in December 2019 in Wuhan city, China. The COVID-19 pandemic has infected more than 46.4 million people, with 1,199,727 deaths. The immune system plays a crucial role in the severity of COVID-19 and the development of pneumonia-induced acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Along with providing protection, both innate and T cell-based adaptive immune response dysregulate during severe SARS-CoV2 infection. This dysregulation is more pronounced in older population and patients with comorbidities (Diabetes, hypertension, obesity, other pulmonary and autoimmune diseases). However, COVID-19 patients develop protective antibodies (Abs) against SARS-CoV2, but they do not long for last. The induction of the immune response against the pathogen also requires metabolic energy that generates through the process of immunometabolism. The change in the metabolic stage of immune cells from homeostasis to an inflammatory or infectious environment is called immunometabolic reprogramming. The article describes the cellular immunology (macrophages, T cells, B cells, dendritic cells, NK cells and pulmonary epithelial cells (PEC) and vascular endothelial cells) and the associated immune response during COVID-19. Immunometabolism may serve as a cell-specific therapeutic approach to target COVID-19.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>As people around the world anxiously watched the early development of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, they expected Taiwan be one of the hardest-hit countries. Yet, to the surprise of many onlookers, the country has managed to keep severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 at bay. Taiwan has taken decisive actions to prevent spread of the virus since the very beginning of the epidemic. While the fight is still ongoing, we provide an overview of major policies and strategies undertaken in Taiwan to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic, analyzing them from a sociopolitical perspective. We found that the centralized and professional leadership, democratic and accountable political culture, and vibrant civil society and broad social participation are the key features of disease control in Taiwan.</AbstractText>

She had no adenopathy, but her erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were both significantly elevated at 90 mm/h and 19.61 mg/dL, respectively. The patient was then transferred to the regional children's hospital due to a clinical suspicion for MIS-C, and subsequent COVID-19 immunoglobulin G testing was positive. She had been empirically started on intravenous immunoglobulin in addition to 81 mg aspirin daily. Initial echocardiograms showed mild dilatation of the left main coronary artery, and on repeat echocardiogram, a right coronary artery aneurysm was also identified. Oral prednisone therapy (5 mg) was initiated and the patient was discharged on a continued prednisone taper. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: We present a case of a 15-year-old girl who presented to the ED with MIS-C who developed coronary aneurysms despite early therapy, to increase awareness among emergency physicians of this emerging condition.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Recent infectious disease outbreaks, including the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic and Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, have demonstrated the critical importance of resilient health systems in safeguarding global health security. Importantly, the human, economic and political tolls of these crises are being amplified by health systems' inabilities to respond quickly and effectively. Improving resilience within health systems can build on pre-existing strengths to enhance the readiness of health system actors to respond to crises, while also maintaining core functions. Using data gathered from a scoping literature review, interviews with key informants and from stakeholders who attended a workshop held in Dhaka, Bangladesh, we developed a Health System Resilience Checklist ('the checklist'). The aim of the checklist is to measure the specific capacities, capabilities and processes that health systems need in order to ensure resilience in the face of both infectious disease outbreaks and natural hazards. The checklist is intended to be adapted and used in a broad set of countries as a component of ongoing processes to ensure that health actors, institutions and populations can mount an effective response to infectious disease outbreaks and natural hazards while also maintaining core healthcare services. The checklist is an important first step in improving health system resilience to these threats, but additional research and resources will be necessary to further refine and prioritise the checklist items and to pilot the checklist with the frontline health facilities that would be using it. This will help ensure its feasibility and durability for the long-term within the health systems strengthening and health security fields.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Incidents of viral outbreaks have increased at an alarming rate over the past decades. The most recent human coronavirus known as COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) has already spread around the world and shown R<sub>0</sub> values from 2.2 to 2.68. However, the ratio between mortality and number of infections seems to be lower in this case in comparison to other human coronaviruses (such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)). These outbreaks have tested the limits of healthcare systems and have posed serious questions about management using conventional therapies and diagnostic tools. In this regard, the use of nanotechnology offers new opportunities for the development of novel strategies in terms of prevention, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 and other viral infections. In this review, we discuss the use of nanotechnology for COVID-19 virus management by the development of nano-based materials, such as disinfectants, personal protective equipment, diagnostic systems and nanocarrier systems, for treatments and vaccine development, as well as the challenges and drawbacks that need addressing.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Severely ill coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients show elevated concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines, a situation commonly known as a cytokine storm. The p38 MAPK receptor is considered a plausible therapeutic target because of its involvement in the platelet activation processes leading to inflammation. This study aimed to identify potential natural product-derived inhibitory molecules against the p38α MAPK receptor to mitigate the eliciting of pro-inflammatory cytokines using computational techniques. The 3D X-ray structure of the receptor with PDB ID 3ZS5 was energy minimized using GROMACS and used for molecular docking via AutoDock Vina. The molecular docking was validated with an acceptable area under the curve (AUC) of 0.704, which was computed from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. A compendium of 38,271 natural products originating from Africa and China together with eleven known p38 MAPK inhibitors were screened against the receptor. Four potential lead compounds ZINC1691180, ZINC5519433, ZINC4520996 and ZINC5733756 were identified. The compounds formed strong intermolecular bonds with critical residues Val38, Ala51, Lys53, Thr106, Leu108, Met109 and Phe169. Additionally, they exhibited appreciably low binding energies which were corroborated via molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) calculations. The compounds were also predicted to have plausible pharmacological profiles with insignificant toxicity. The molecules were also predicted to be anti-inflammatory, kinase inhibitors, antiviral, platelet aggregation inhibitors, and immunosuppressive, with probable activity (Pa) greater than probable inactivity (Pi). ZINC5733756 is structurally similar to estradiol with a Tanimoto coefficient value of 0.73, which exhibits anti-inflammatory activity by targeting the activation of Nrf2. Similarly, ZINC1691180 has been reported to elicit anti-inflammatory activity in vitro. The compounds may serve as scaffolds for the design of potential biotherapeutic molecules against the cytokine storm associated with COVID-19.</AbstractText>

A plethora of microbial domains including viruses (other than SARS-CoV-2), bacteria, archaea and fungi have evolved together, and interact in complex molecular pathogenesis along with SARS-CoV-2. However, the involvement of other microbial co-pathogens and underlying molecular mechanisms leading to extortionate ailment in critically ill COVID-19 patients has yet not been extensively reviewed. Although, the incidence of co-infections could be up to 94.2% in laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, the fate of co-infections among SARS-CoV-2 infected hosts often depends on the balance between the host's protective immunity and immunopathology. Predominantly identified co-pathogens of SARS-CoV-2 are bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Legionella pneumophila and Clamydia pneumoniae followed by viruses including influenza, coronavirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, parainfluenza, metapneumovirus, influenza B virus, and human immunodeficiency virus. The cross-talk between co-pathogens (especially lung microbiomes), SARS-CoV-2 and host is an important factor that ultimately increases the difficulty of diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of COVID-19. Simultaneously, co-infecting microbiotas may use new strategies to escape host defense mechanisms by altering both innate and adaptive immune responses to further aggravate SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Better understanding of co-infections in COVID-19 is critical for the effective patient management, treatment and containment of SARS-CoV-2. This review therefore necessitates the comprehensive investigation of commonly reported microbial co-pathogens amid COVID-19, their transmission pattern along with the possible mechanism of co-infections and outcomes. Thus, identifying the possible co-pathogens and their underlying molecular mechanisms during SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis may shed light in developing diagnostics, appropriate curative and preventive interventions for suspected SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infections in the current pandemic.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2021.

Type H ARDS is associated with hypoxemia due to diffuse alveolar damage-induced high right-to-left shunts. Immunothrombosis occurs at the site of infection due to innate immune inflammatory and coagulofibrinolytic responses to SARS-CoV-2, resulting in microvascular occlusion with hypoperfusion of the lungs. Lung immunothrombosis in type L ARDS results from neutrophil extracellular traps containing platelets and fibrin in the lung microvasculature, leading to hypoxemia due to impaired blood flow and a high ventilation/perfusion (VA/Q) ratio.

                <AbstractText>Since March 2020, the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a threat to global health. Several kinds of coronavirus-associated disorders, including vascular involvements with neurological symptoms, have been reported worldwide. Here, we describe two individuals with COVID-19 with no history of traumatic brain injury nor of vascular injuries, who developed spontaneous subdural haematoma in a subacute process. Both individuals became lethargic and unresponsive during admission in the intensive care unit. Both have undergone emergent craniotomy with acceptable outcome. The first patient improved significantly and was discharged a week after surgery. However, the second individual had no improvement on her consciousness and died 3 days after surgery. Haemorrhagic events, including subdural haematoma, can happen during COVID-19 infection with several possible mechanisms. Brain imaging and further neurological evaluation must be performed in any individuals with COVID-19 who show signs of alteration in their state of consciousness.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Currently no specific medicinal treatment exists against the new SARS-CoV2 and chloroquine is widely used, since it can decrease the length of hospital stay and improve the evolution of the associated COVID-19 pneumonia. However, several safety concerns have been raised from chloroquine use due to the lack of essential information regarding its dosing. The aim of this study is to provide a critical appraisal of the safety information regarding chloroquine treatment and to apply simulation techniques to unveil relationships between the observed serious adverse events and overdosing, as well as to propose optimized dosage regimens. The dose related adverse events of chloroquine are unveiled and maximum tolerated doses and concentration levels are quoted. Among others, treatment with chloroquine can lead to severe adverse effects like prolongation of the QT interval and cardiomyopathy. In case of chloroquine overdosing, conditions similar to those produced by SARS-CoV2, such as pulmonary oedema with respiratory insufficiency and circulatory collapse, can be observed. Co-administration of chloroquine with other drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, like azithromycin, can further increase the risk of QT prolongation and cardiomyopathy. For elder patients there is a high risk for toxicity and dose reduction should be made. This study unveils the risks of some widely used dosing regimens and binds the observed serious adverse events with dosing. Based on simulations, safer alternative dosage regimens are proposed and recommendations regarding chloroquine dosing are made.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label=""Background"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has accentuated the need for speedy access to information. Digital divide and socio-demographic disparity create an information hiatus and therefore unhealthy practices with regard to dealing with COVID-19, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""Aims"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">We assessed knowledge, attitudes, practices and their determinants regarding COVID-19 in Pakistan during March-April 2020.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""Methods"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">905 adults ≥18 years (males and females) participated: 403 from a web-based survey; 365 from an urban survey; and 137 from a rural survey. Frequency of adequate knowledge, attitudes and practices for the three populations was determined based on available global guidelines. Multivariable logistic regression analysis determined factors of adequacy of knowledge, attitudes, practices, and association of knowledge with attitudes and practices.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""Results"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">Mean age of the participants was 33.5 (+ SD 11.1) years, 51% were females. More females and young adults (18-30 years) participated in the web-based survey. The urban survey and web-based survey participants had significantly higher adequate knowledge (2-7 times) and practices (4-5 times) towards COVID-19. Adequate knowledge had a significant influence on healthy attitudes and practices for COVID-19, after adjustment for covariates. Overall, two-thirds of the population had high levels of fear about COVID-19, which was highest among the rural survey population.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""Conclusion"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">Substantial gaps exist in adequate knowledge, attitudes and practices, particularly among rural populations, and underscores the variation in access to information according to level of education and access to the internet. Thus, a comprehensive, contextually congruent awareness raising strategy is urgently needed to confront COVID-19 among these populations.</AbstractText>

Neurologic complications from COVID-19 were reported in the early stages of the pandemic and are now increasingly recognized. These include various symptoms like headache and anosmia as well as neurologic complications of severe COVID-19 like encephalopathy, seizures, and stroke. There are few reports of direct involvement of the central nervous system with SARS-CoV-2 causing meningoencephalitis. There is concern for higher incidence and severity of COVID-19 in patients with chronic neurologic conditions.

To determine the need for enhanced precautions to prevent potential spread via aerosolized particles, we used an optical particle sizer to measure aerosol generation intraoperatively during a case series of MT insertion. We also discuss our institutional experience with safe pandemic-era perioperative practices. There was no measured increase in aerosol particle number during the procedure at a distance of 30 cm from the external auditory canal. These initial data are reassuring regarding the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to the operating room team due to aerosol generation, but further study is necessary before making definitive recommendations.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>The RNA polymerase inhibitor favipiravir is currently in clinical trials as a treatment for infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), despite limited information about the molecular basis for its activity. Here we report the structure of favipiravir ribonucleoside triphosphate (favipiravir-RTP) in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) bound to a template:primer RNA duplex, determined by electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM) to a resolution of 2.5 Å. The structure shows clear evidence for the inhibitor at the catalytic site of the enzyme, and resolves the conformation of key side chains and ions surrounding the binding pocket. Polymerase activity assays indicate that the inhibitor is weakly incorporated into the RNA primer strand, and suppresses RNA replication in the presence of natural nucleotides. The structure reveals an unusual, nonproductive binding mode of favipiravir-RTP at the catalytic site of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, which explains its low rate of incorporation into the RNA primer strand. Together, these findings inform current and future efforts to develop polymerase inhibitors for SARS coronaviruses.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">Anonymous aggregate readership data was obtained from 2 Minute Medicine® (www.2minutemedicine.com), an open-access, physician-run medical news organization that has published over 8000 original physician-written text and visual summaries of new medical research since 2013. In this retrospective observational study, the average article views, actions (defined as the sum of views, shares, and outbound link clicks), read times, and bounce rate (probability to leave a page in &lt;30s) were compared between COVID-19 articles published between January 1 to May 31, 2020 (N = 40) to non-COVID-19 articles (N = 145) published in the same time period.

                <AbstractText>The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus requires reliable assays for studying viral entry mechanisms which remains poorly understood. This knowledge is important for the development of therapeutic approaches to control SARS-CoV-2 infection by permitting the screening for neutralizing antibodies and other agents that can block infection. This is particularly important for patients who are at high risk for severe outcomes related to COVID-19. The production of pseudotyped viral particles may seem like a daunting task for a non-virology laboratory without experience in the two most commonly used pseudotyping systems, namely retro/lentiviruses and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) which lacks the VSV envelope glycoprotein (VSVΔG). By incorporating the most up-to-date knowledge, we have developed a detailed, easy-to-follow novel protocol for producing SARS-CoV-2 spike-bearing pseudovirus using the VSV-ΔG system. We describe the infection assay which uses GFP fluorescence as a measure of infection in a 24-well live imaging system. We present results of our optimization of the system to enhance viral infection levels through the over-expression of human ACE2 receptor and the overexpression of at least one of two proteases - TMPRSS2 or Furin, as well as, supplementation with Poloxamer 407 (P407) and Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) as adjuvants. We show that the system works efficiently in three unrelated, clinically relevant cell lines: human 293T (renal epithelial) cells, human Calu-3 (lung epithelial) cells, and the non-human primate (African Green Monkey) cell line, Vero-E6 (renal epithelial) cells. In addition, we have used this system to show infection of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPS-CMs). This system is efficient (virus generation, titration, and infection assays can be performed in 1 week), quantitative, inexpensive, and readily scalable for application in drug development and therapeutic screening approaches.</AbstractText>

Understanding and documenting these experiences is important to inform the ongoing response to COVID-19 and disaster preparedness efforts.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""OBJECTIVE"">The aim of this study was to examine the psychosocial impacts of COVID-19 on a sample of Australian adults.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">The data analyzed were derived from a larger cross-sectional survey of Australian adults that was administered during the month of May 2020. Participants (N=3483) were asked in which ways COVID-19 had most greatly impacted them; the responses produced a text data set containing 1 COVID-19 impact story for each participant, totaling 86,642 words. Participants also completed assessments of their sociodemographic characteristics (sex, age, financial stress), level of concern related to COVID-19, personality trait profile, and satisfaction with life. Impact stories were analyzed using sentiment analysis and compared against the Theoretical Domains Framework to determine the most frequently impacted life domains. Finally, a multinomial regression analysis, stratified by participant sex, was conducted to identify the associations of psychological and demographic socializations with sentiment toward COVID-19.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">In total, 3483 participants completed the survey, the majority of whom were female (n=2793, 80.2%). Participants' impact stories were most commonly categorized as neutral (1544/3483, 44.3%), followed by negative (1136/3483, 32.6%) and positive (802/3483, 23.1%). The most frequently impacted life domains included behavioral regulation, environmental context and resources, social influences, and emotions, suggesting that the COVID-19 pandemic was impacting these areas of participants' lives the most. Finally, the regression results suggested that for women, lower satisfaction with life and higher financial stress were associated with increased likelihood of negative, rather than positive, sentiment (P&lt;.001); however, the proportion of variance in the sentiment that was explained was very small (&lt;5%).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Participant sentiment toward COVID-19 varied. High rates of neutral and negative sentiment were identified. Positive sentiment was identified but was not as common. Impacts to different areas of people's lives were identified, with a major emphasis on behavioral regulation and related domains such as social influences, environmental context and resources, and emotions. Findings may inform the development of mental health and social support resources and interventions to help alleviate the psychosocial consequences of disaster response measures.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>©Jillian Ryan, Hamza Sellak, Emily Brindal.

                <AbstractText>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) arising from Wuhan, China, is currently outbreaking worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 to be a global pandemic. COVID-19 could cause a wide range of symptoms ranging from self-limiting fever, sore throat, and cough to more severe symptoms that could lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome. As a result of the lockdown and increased demand, drug shortages could become a growing global issue. This article aims to shed light on the potential impact of drug shortages as a result of this pandemic on patient outcomes and the role of pharmacists and pharmacy policymakers in alleviating this emerging problem.</AbstractText>

The COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed for all patients. Median time to seeking medical care after COVID-19 was 4 [3; 7] months. The diagnosis of myocarditis was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the heart (n=10) and by endomyocardial biopsy of the right ventricle (n=6). The virus was detected in the myocardium with PCR; immunohistochemical (IHC) study with antibody to SARS-Cov-2 was performed; anticardiac antibody level was measured; and echocardiography and Holter monitoring were performed. Hemodynamically significant coronary atherosclerosis was excluded for all patients older than 40 years.Results    All patients showed a clear connection between the emergence or exacerbation of cardiac symptoms and COVID-19. 11 patients did not have any signs of heart disease before COVID-19; 4 patients had previously had moderate arrhythmia or heart failure (HF) without myocarditis. Symptoms of myocarditis emerged at 1-5 months following COVID-19. MRI revealed typical late gadolinium accumulation, signs of hyperemia, and one case of edema. The level of anticardiac antibodies was increased 3-4 times in 73 % больных. Two major clinical variants of post-COVID myocarditis were observed. 1. Arrhythmic (n=6), with newly developed extrasystole or atrial fibrillation without systolic dysfunction. 2. Decompensated variant with systolic dysfunction and biventricular HF (n=9). Mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 34.1±7.8 %, and left ventricular end-diastolic dimension was 5.8±0.7 cm. In one case, myocarditis was associated with signs of IgG4‑negative aortitis. SARS-Cov-2 RNA was found in 5 of 6 biopsy samples of the myocardium. The longest duration of SARS-Cov-2 persistence in the myocardium was 9 months following COVID-19. By using antibody to the Spike antigen and nucleocapsid, SARS-Cov-2 was detected in cardiomyocytes, endothelium, and macrophages. Five patients were diagnosed with lymphocytic myocarditis; one with giant-cell myocarditis; three patients had signs of endocarditis (infectious, lymphocytic with mural thrombosis).Conclusion    Subacute/chronic post-COVID myocarditis with isolated arrhythmias or systolic dysfunction is characterized by long-term (up to 9 months) persistence of SARS-Cov-2 in the myocardium in combination with a high immune activity. Endocarditis can manifest either as infectious or as nonbacterial thromboendocarditis. A possibility of using corticosteroids and anticoagulants in the treatment of post-COVID myoendocarditis should be studied.</AbstractText></Abstract>",0,2021-07-28 00:00:00

                <AbstractText>The current pandemic of COVID-19, with its climbing number of cases and deaths, has us searching for tools for rapid, reliable, and affordable methods of detection on one hand, and novel, improved therapeutic strategies on the other. The currently employed RT-PCR method, despite its all-encompassing utility, has its shortcomings. Newer diagnostic tools, based on the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/Cas(CRISPR-Cas) system, with its better diagnostic accuracy measures, have come up to fill that void. These assay platforms are expected to slowly take up the place of COVID-19 diagnostics. Further, the current therapeutic options focus mainly on counteracting the viral proteins and components and their entry into host cells. The CRISPR-based system, especially through the RNA-guided Cas13 approach, can identify the genomic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and provide a novel inhibition strategy for coronaviruses. In this mini-review, we have discussed the available and upcoming CRISPR-based diagnostic assays and the potential of the CRISPR/Cas system as a therapeutic or prevention strategy in COVID-19. CRISPR-Cas system shows promise in both diagnostics as well as therapeutics and may as well change the face of molecular diagnosis and precision medicine.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>The Research to Practice column presents an analysis of current and controversial research findings with implications for practice change relevant to emergency care settings. This review critiques Johnson et al.'s (2016) investigation, titled ""The Impact of Cognitive Stressors in the Emergency Department on Physician Implicit Racial Bias,"" that examined emergency department characteristics and stressors and their effects on physician racial bias and decision making. Their findings suggest that unconscious biases can affect clinical decisions when providers experience increased cognitive stress. The implications are significant for emergency providers as resources are especially strained during the COVID-19 pandemic and as the adverse effects of unconscious bias on health disparities and patient outcomes have become clearly apparent. Implicit bias training (IBT) is recommended for emergency providers and has significant implications for medical and nurse educators in executing and evaluating IBT outcomes.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Introduction Increased virulence, the severity of illness, and mortality have all been hypothesized with respect to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi)/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) use in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Our study aims to assess whether ACEi/ARB use in patients with COVID-19 conferred worsened severity of illness or increased mortality. Additionally, we explore the possibility of an unearthed protective benefit due to their interruption of the RAS signaling pathway as observed in cardiovascular diseases. Methods The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and EMBASE were searched for studies relevant to COVID-19 severity, mortality, and inflammation in the context of ACEi/ARB use. Eight studies were included with a total of 17,943 patients, 4,292 (23.9%) of which were taking an ACEi or an ARB. The study population was 47.9% female and the average age across all studies was 65. The studies chosen had a sample size of at least 100 patients. Results Mortality outcomes were assessed in six studies and showed no significant difference in mortality among the ACEi/ARB and control groups (odds ratio [OR]: 0.99, 95%CI: 0.48-2.04). Seven studies assessed the severity of COVID-19 and showed no statistically significant difference in disease severity when comparing the ACEi/ARB group to the control group (odds ratio [OR]: 1.30, 95% CI 0.87-1.94). Four studies reported the length of stay with no significant difference between the ACEi/ARB groups as compared to non-users. Four studies included inflammatory markers C-reactive protein (CRP) and D-Dimer, which were noted to be consistently lower in the ACEi/ARB groups when compared to control groups, however, this was not statistically significant. Conclusion Our study found no significant difference in mortality, severity of illness, or length of stay between ACEi/ARB users and non-users with COVID-19 infection. These results support the continuation of ACEi and ARBs in the setting of COVID-19 as advised by the American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA). The decrease in CRP and D-dimer suggests a possible protective effect related to ACEi/ARB use in COVID-19, however, more studies with larger sample sizes are needed to establish this effect.</AbstractText>

In a short lapse of time, this virus was successful in spreading at a blistering pace throughout the globe, hence raising the flag of pandemic status. The mounting number of deaths with each elapsing day has summoned researchers from all around the world to play their part in driving this SARS-CoV-2 pandemic to an end. As of now, multiple research teams are immersed in either scrutinizing various antiviral drugs for their efficacy or developing different types of vaccines that will be capable of providing long-term immunity against this deadly virus. The mini-review sheds light on the possible approaches that can be undertaken to curb the COVID-19 spread. Possible strategies comprise viral vector-based, nucleic acid-based, protein-based, inactivated and weakened virus vaccines; COVID-19 vaccine being developed by deploying Hyleukin-7 technology; plant-based chimeric protein and subunit vaccines; humanized nano-bodies and human antibodies; intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion therapy; inhibitors for ACE-2, Angiotensin 1 receptor (AT1R), complement system, viral proteins, host cell protease and endocytosis; shield immunity; IL-6R, NKG2A and hACE2-SARS-CoV-2-RBD interaction blocking monoclonal antibodies; SARS-CoV RdRp-based drugs, traditional Chinese medicine, repositioned and anti-viral drugs. These vaccines and drugs are currently being screened in the clinical trials as several of them have manifested positive results, hence increasing the probability of becoming one of the potential treatments for this disease.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Lung ultrasound (LUS) imaging as a point-of-care diagnostic tool for lung pathologies has been proven superior to X-ray and comparable to CT, enabling earlier and more accurate diagnosis in real-time at the patient's bedside. The main limitation to widespread use is its dependence on the operator training and experience. COVID-19 lung ultrasound findings predominantly reflect a pneumonitis pattern, with pleural effusion being infrequent. However, pleural effusion is easy to detect and to quantify, therefore it was selected as the subject of this study, which aims to develop an automated system for the interpretation of LUS of pleural effusion. A LUS dataset was collected at the Royal Melbourne Hospital which consisted of 623 videos containing 99,209 2D ultrasound images of 70 patients using a phased array transducer. A standardized protocol was followed that involved scanning six anatomical regions providing complete coverage of the lungs for diagnosis of respiratory pathology. This protocol combined with a deep learning algorithm using a Spatial Transformer Network provides a basis for automatic pathology classification on an image-based level. In this work, the deep learning model was trained using supervised and weakly supervised approaches which used frame- and video-based ground truth labels respectively. The reference was expert clinician image interpretation. Both approaches show comparable accuracy scores on the test set of 92.4% and 91.1%, respectively, not statistically significantly different. However, the video-based labelling approach requires significantly less effort from clinical experts for ground truth labelling.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic. It is still uncontrolled in most countries and no therapies are currently available. Various drugs are under investigation for its treatment. The disease is known to have worse outcomes in patients who have underlying cardiovascular disease. Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, remdesivir and lopinavir/ritonavir are currently being studied in trials and show some promise. Conduction disorders, heart failure, and mortality have been reported with the use of these drugs. It is important to have knowledge of potential cardiotoxic effects of these drugs before using them for COVID-19 patients for better allocation of healthcare resources and improvement in clinical outcomes.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText><b>Introduction:</b> Brain health is neglected in public health, receiving attention after something goes wrong. Neuroplasticity research illustrates that preventive steps strengthen the brain's component systems; however, this information is not widely known. Actionable steps are needed to scale proven population-level interventions. <b>Objectives:</b> This pilot tested two main objectives: (1) the feasibility/ease of use of an online platform to measure brain health, deliver training, and offer virtual coaching to healthy adults and (2) to develop a data driven index of brain health. Methods: 180 participants, ages 18-87, enrolled in this 12-week pilot. Participants took a BrainHealth Index™ (BHI), a composite of assessments encompassing cognition, well-being, daily-life and social, pre-post training. Participants engaged in online training with three coaching sessions. We assessed changes in BHI, effects of training utilization and demographics, contributions of sub-domain measures to the BHI and development of a factor analytic structure of latent BrainHealth constructs. <b>Results:</b> The results indicated that 75% of participants showed at least a 5-point gain on their BHI which did not depend on age, education, or gender. The contribution to these gains were from all sub-domains, including stress, anxiety and resilience, even though training focused largely on cognition. Some individuals improved due to increased resilience and decreased anxiety, whereas others improved due to increased innovation and social engagement. Larger gains depended on module utilization, especially strategy training. An exploratory factor analytic solution to the correlation matrix of online assessments identified three latent constructs. <b>Discussion/Conclusion:</b> This pilot study demonstrated the efficacy of an online platform to assess changes on a composite BrainHealth Index and efficacy in delivering training modules and coaching. We found that adults, college age to late life, were motivated to learn about their brain and engage in virtual-training with coaching to improve their brain health. This effort intends to scale up to thousands, thus the pilot data, tested by an impending imaging pilot, will be utilized in ongoing machine learning (ML) algorithms to develop a precision brain health model. This pilot is a first step in scaling evidence-based brain health protocols to reach individuals and positively affect public health globally.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"">Real-time polymerase chain reaction using nasopharyngeal swabs is currently the most widely used diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2 detection. However, false negatives and the sensitivity of this mode of testing have posed challenges in the accurate estimation of the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection rates.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""OBJECTIVE"">The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether technical and, therefore, correctable errors were being made with regard to nasopharyngeal swab procedures.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">We searched a web-based video database (YouTube) for videos demonstrating SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab tests, posted from January 1 to May 15, 2020. Videos were rated by 3 blinded rhinologists for accuracy of swab angle and depth. The overall score for swab angle and swab depth for each nasopharyngeal swab demonstration video was determined based on the majority score with agreement between at least 2 of the 3 reviewers. We then comparatively evaluated video data collected from YouTube videos demonstrating the correct nasopharyngeal swab technique with data from videos demonstrating an incorrect nasopharyngeal swab technique. Multiple linear regression analysis with statistical significance set at P=.05 was performed to determine video data variables associated with the correct nasopharyngeal swab technique.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">In all, 126 videos met the study inclusion and exclusion criteria. Of these, 52.3% (66/126) of all videos demonstrated the correct swab angle, and 46% (58/126) of the videos demonstrated an appropriate swab depth. Moreover, 45.2% (57/126) of the videos demonstrated both correct nasopharyngeal swab angle and appropriate depth, whereas 46.8% (59/126) of the videos demonstrated both incorrect nasopharyngeal swab angle and inappropriate depth. Videos with correct nasopharyngeal swab technique were associated with the swab operators identifying themselves as a medical professional or as an Ear, Nose, Throat-related medical professional. We also found an association between correct nasopharyngeal swab techniques and recency of video publication date (relative to May 15, 2020).</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Our findings show that over half of the videos documenting the nasopharyngeal swab test showed an incorrect technique, which could elevate false-negative test rates. Therefore, greater attention needs to be provided toward educating frontline health care workers who routinely perform nasopharyngeal swab procedures.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label=""AIMS"">Patients with diabetes, including those with foot complications, are at highest risk for severe outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) present additional challenges given their superimposed risk for severe infections and amputations. The main objectives were to develop a triage algorithm to effectively risk-stratify all DFUs for potential complications, complying with social distancing regulations, preserving personal protective equipment, and to assess feasibility of virtual care for DFU.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">Longitudinal study during the COVID-19 pandemic performed at a large tertiary institution evaluating the effectiveness of a targeted triage protocol developed using a combined approach of virtual care, electronic medical record data mining, and tracing for rapid risk stratification to derive optimal care delivery methods. 2868 patients with diabetes at risk for foot complications within last 12 months were included and rates of encounters, hospitalizations, and minor amputations were compared to one year prior.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">The STRIDE protocol was implemented in 1-week and eventually included 2600 patients (90.7%) demonstrating effective triage. During normal operations, 40% (938 of 2345) of all visits were due to DFUs and none were performed virtually. After implementation, 98% face-to-face visits were due to DFU, and virtual visits increased by 21,900%. This risk stratified approach led to similar low rates of DFU-related-hospitalization and minor amputation rates 20% versus 24% (p &gt; 0.05) during and prior the pandemic, respectively.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Implementation of STRIDE protocol was effective to risk-stratify and triage all patients with diabetic foot complications preventing increase in hospitalization and amputations while promoting both social and physical distancing.</AbstractText>

In many settings, TB resources, facilities and equipment are being redirected towards COVID-19 response.AimWe sought to assess the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on TB services in the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region.MethodsThe fifty-three European Region Member States were asked to report qualitative and quantitative data in quarter one and two (Q1 and Q2) 2020. TB notifications were triangulated with the severity score on domestic movement restrictions to assess how they may have influenced TB detection.ResultsTwenty-nine countries reported monthly TB notifications for the first half of 2019 and 2020. TB notifications decreased by 35.5% during Q2 2020 compared with Q2 2019, which is six-fold more than the average annual decrease of 5.1% documented during 2015-2019. The number of patients enrolled in rifampicin-resistant/multidrug-resistant TB treatment also decreased dramatically in Q2 2020, by 33.5%. The highest movement restriction severity score was observed between April and May 2020, which coincided with the highest observed decrease in TB notifications.ConclusionA decrease in TB detection and enrolment to treatment may cause increases in TB burden and threatens the Region's ability to reach the TB targets of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, still this might be mitigated with rapid restoration of TB services and the implementation of targeted interventions during periods with severe PHSM in place, such as those introduced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</AbstractText></Abstract>",0,2021-08-06 00:00:00

In contrast, a mechanism-based approach suggests that mask wearing should be expected to reduce transmission: so that contrary evidence from RCTs likely reflects the need to focus policy attention on addressing interacting or mediating factors that offset the basic positive effect. The differing conclusions that result from these two approaches reflect the limitations of RCT-based approaches that are compounded in scenarios, such as pandemics, where urgent decisions are required with limited evidence.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Covid-19 is a respiratory disease caused by coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) first identified in Wuhan, China (December 2019). The disease rapidly crossed the barrier of countries, continents and spread globally. Non-pharmaceutical measures such as social distancing, face mask, frequent hand washing and use of sanitizer remained the best available option to prevent the spread of disease. OPD, IPD admissions, elective O. Ts were curtailed. Orthopedic care was only limited to emergency and semi-urgent procedures like necrotizing fasciitis, open fracture, and compartment syndrome. These measures were taken to preserve infrastructure and manpower to manage covid-19 pandemic. The children were thought to have a low susceptibility to covid-19 as compared to an adult. Deferring the patient during pandemic has led to high orthopedic disease burden, morbidity and disease-related sequelae, hence elective care must be resumed with modified hospital infrastructure. Resumption of elective/emergent orthopedic care should be slow, phasic and strategic, much similar to unlocking. Cases must be stratified depending on covid status and severity. Dedicated O.Ts with neutral/negative pressure and HEPA filter for covid positive and suspected patients are to be used. All symptomatic and suspected patients should be investigated for covid-19 by RT-PCR, blood counts and CT scan. Regional anaesthesia should be preferred to General anaesthesia. Power drill/saw/burr/pulse lavage should be minimized to avoid aerosol generation. Postoperatively continuous surveillance and monitoring to be done for covid related symptoms. Medical institutes rapidly shifted to the online mode of education.

                <AbstractText>Pregnant women are at higher risk for developing severe complications of COVID-19 including preterm delivery, respiratory failure, and death. Although vaccines to prevent COVID-19 are being developed, pregnant women are not included in the current COVID-19 vaccine trials and initially this population may not be eligible for COVID-19 vaccines due to lack of safety testing in pregnancy. As an alternate approach, we discuss the concept of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) using medications that are approved for use in pregnant women to prevent gestational problems and severe illness in this high-risk population. In particular, the use of hydroxychloroquine PrEP affords a safe and readily available means to avoid COVID-19 complications in pregnancy.</AbstractText>

Teleconferencing software was deployed by many institutions to comply with quarantine and social-distancing regulations. To supplement the loss of clinical experience for trainees, the authors implemented a novel virtual-educational programming using virtual visiting professors and virtual grand rounds. The authors describe the two different formats and advantages such as access to multiple speakers on diverse, innovative topics and decreased financial burdens to the host program. However, the authors do acknowledge some disadvantages from lack of face-to-face social interaction/networking and the need to consider time-zone differences. Both new programs were embraced by trainees at the authors' own institution and residents/medical students across the United States and Canada and around the world. The authors believe teleconferencing should be permanently incorporated into future educational opportunities for plastic surgeons, as it provides easy access to high-quality information.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2021 by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>",0,2021-05-03 00:00:00
